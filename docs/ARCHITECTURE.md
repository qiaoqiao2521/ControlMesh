# Architecture

## Overview

Scope note (2026-09-30): the map below describes preserved CM implementations. The next
product direction is [Paperclip-based CM](../plans/paperclip-based-cm/task_plan.md); its local
CLI dispatch/idle/event-wake/review and local Feishu text closed-loop are verified.
Production migration remains open. Preserved Python and historical Orca candidate sections
must not be read as a Paperclip migration claim.

Selected boundary: upstream Paperclip source stays unmodified. CM may supply a thin external
orchestration layer through supported interfaces. Pre-execution direction review is recorded
in the current plan but is not implemented or part of the repository closeout CLI.

ControlMesh is a Python-owned local task runtime. Terminal and messaging entry points feed
an orchestrator and persistent TaskHub, which execute official provider CLIs and store
runtime state, memory, workspaces, events, and artifacts. A versioned read-only API exposes
safe projections to TypeScript protocol, SDK, and Web layers.

## Components

### Runtime and Task Lifecycle

Responsibilities:

- persist task identity, status, binding, timestamps, questions, results, and recovery state;
- implement create, tell, ask_parent, resume, cancel, timeout, and result delivery;
- run approved topology behavior on the shared TaskHub execution seam.

Key locations:

- `controlmesh/tasks/`
- `controlmesh/runtime/`
- `controlmesh/team/`
- `controlmesh/multiagent/`

Python owns all mutation and recovery decisions.

Execution evidence is keyed by the shared `packet_id + task_id + line + plan_id` identity.
The runtime store admits a terminal result only from the persisted plan owner and only for
the latest task episode. An identical retry returns the original event; a conflicting retry
or packet identity drift is rejected before JSONL append. Summary promotion loads that
single current terminal result, admits only `completed`, and rechecks execution, persisted
review, and summary snapshots in the writer's immediate pre-write hook.

### Historical Orca Bridge Candidate (superseded by Paperclip)

Native graph reuse boundary (source audit: c6a72169 / 1.4.197): Orca owns persisted
Task/deps and pending-to-ready promotion inside task/worker settlement transactions.
`parent_id` is hierarchy, deps are execution dependencies, and Dispatch identifies an attempt.
Supported task-create/task-list/worker-start operations are the integration surface; the
retired automatic coordinator loop is not a CM library or a current auto-dispatch guarantee.
Native completed unlocks execution dependencies, not independent controller acceptance.
CM exposes native task dependencies via `cm orca task-list` and workbench `/tasks`.
Workbench formal `/question`, `/answer`, `/snapshot`, `/accept` commands use a pure parser
and the same controller entrypoint as CLI; no second answer/acceptance implementation.
Only explicit candidate mode selects the pinned patched backend; native controller evidence
and per-request journal rules remain required. Receipts do not automatically promote slot state.
The pure `task_view.py` projection validates Run identity and snapshot relationships, strips
unrelated payloads, and renders bounded text; it never calculates readiness, dispatches or
consumes the inbox. `/status` remains the local worker-slot view. CLI JSON retains the full
accepted snapshot (at most 512 tasks); text truncation is explicit.
This is a reuse map, not proof that the installed 1.4.201 backend or bridge has passed the
graph/multi-agent workflow. See [Orca bridge candidate status](orca-bridge-status.md).

`controlmesh/orca_bridge/client.py` reads a deliberately selected local Orca 1.4.201
through its CLI. `cm orca status|worker-show|request-show|task-list` is an opt-in, read-only
view; it never starts Orca, launches a provider, consumes/ACKs the coordinator inbox,
or falls back to TaskHub. Initial status discovery is distinct from queries pinned
to a native runtime incarnation and run/task/dispatch/request identity. Observed
execution state does not grant independent acceptance or prove user delivery.
"Read-only" here describes CM's command surface, not zero upstream DB writes:
Orca workerShow can reconcile an old runtime's starting/stopping worker to unknown.
That reconciliation remains Orca-owned; CM does not access its database.

`orca_bridge/journal.py` is private CM request/delivery bookkeeping, not an Orca
database reader or a task lifecycle store. It retains source-scoped bindings and
original request IDs, rejects conflicting payloads, and admits one outbox send
claim. Uncertain sends are not automatically replayed. Trusted caller binding and
remote receipt validation remain ingress responsibilities.

`rpc.py` uses the authenticated bootstrap (not Orca's DB) to pin a Linux Unix socket.
It checks peer PID/UID, version and runtime on the same connection before mutation;
it never re-discovers/reconnects mid-call. `dispatch.py` reserves two immutable local
slots per run before workerStart and only queries the original request on re-entry.
Only trusted local foreground AGY is admitted; unsupported sources/grants are rejected.
This does not enforce a global Orca worker limit or provide a consumer-generation CAS.

`inbox.py` is the explicit coordinator consumer, separate from all views. `mailbox.py`
persists the entire mixed delivery before ACK, including batches returned by ACK itself.
`feishu_delivery.py` composes the same journal with a single strict original-thread reply;
it is not connected to production ingress. Timeout or unverifiable receipts stay unknown.
`cm orca workbench` provides a lightweight terminal UI with injected non-consuming views
and explicit local dispatch. It does not yet offer the accepted question/review workflow.
`question_view.py` adds an explicit local history projection to the existing journal handle.
The workbench `/questions` command does not reconnect, consume, ACK, or answer; a displayed
candidate has unknown formal question status. Message text is bounded and safely rendered.
The pinned upstream reply can fall back to an ordinary message when no formal question
exists and has no formal-only/expected-generation contract. Automatic Q&A stays disabled;
a pre-read alone would not supply the missing atomic write condition.

An isolated Orca source candidate now adds formal question and immutable Git-object
acceptance contracts with current-controller attestation and transactional identity fences.
It is not the installed 1.4.201 backend. CM's internal candidate transport requires the
new question capability; its default version pin and production entry stay unchanged.
CM inherits native controller evidence from its parent environment for candidate dispatch,
wait/ACK and the four controller contracts. These paths share the same connection builder;
all orchestration frames retain that proof, while status frames never carry it. Explicit
caller fields must match before sending. Passive CLI views can select the candidate version
without acquiring controller authority. Explicit candidate CLI actions use the existing journal
for original-request/payload-digest binding; repeats query historical receipts, and only an
explicit identical-request retry resends. No launch token or answer text enters that journal.
Cross-language socket/dispatcher tests cover this wiring with synthetic PTYs, not a live
coordinator session. Real server deployment additionally proved two CM dispatches and native
worker completion, but exposed missing Node-only hook-authority wiring: status observations
alone do not establish controller authority. The candidate reuses desktop attestation and
retirement callbacks. Agent launchConfig supplies the native launch identity; explicitly
scoped upstream-generated Claude hooks avoid modifying global provider configuration.
With those native hooks, explicit coordinator rebinding now passes real strict snapshot/accept
for two existing completed workers. Independent Git-object checks match both recorded commits;
Run/dispatch remain unchanged while current controller generation advances. This controlled
restart test does not prove survival of live workers or close all takeover/ACK race cases.
Acceptance UI and Feishu delivery remain unqualified. Detailed candidate implementation
and server evidence remain local and are excluded from publication; see
[Orca bridge candidate status](orca-bridge-status.md).
The Python production path and read-only public API remain unchanged.

### Provider Execution

The TS Gemini candidate joins native settings loading and effective-policy loading in
one supervised, read-only Node probe. Trusted registration pins runtime dependencies,
settings/trust sources and policy directories; the returned currentness guard checks
all three. The qualified 0.59 headless projection applies the explicit admin directory
to the loaded settings, and verifies native rules against the requested tool set.
The public CLI rejects the loader-internal `--ignore-env` flag. Execution therefore
requires native merged `advanced.ignoreLocalEnv: true`, verified by the policy probe;
resume argv omits that unsupported flag. This binding is still
pre-execution evidence: normal Gemini task registration, protected process configuration,
session/result recovery and account-backed acceptance remain open. The generic Gemini
restrictive grant mapping remains refused until those execution owners are connected.

`GeminiResumeProcess` now reuses ProcessSupervisor and the native-session flock for
explicitly adopted local compatibility sessions. It runs the joined settings/policy
check, checks the CLI version, retains dispatch before stdin and preserves owned outcomes
before checking success. Completion requires an unchanged transcript prefix and matching
stream/persisted text; retained verification launches no process. Native quota envelopes
abort retries, and cancellation retains the process outcome. Restrictive grants remain
refused. This process primitive is not yet normal TaskHub registration, protected runtime
isolation, a tool-bearing receipt path or an account-backed acceptance result.

`GeminiTaskAdapter` connects that primitive to the durable local queue and existing
kernel effect/observation/reconciliation transactions. It binds the adopted session,
task digest, principal/device and registered configuration, persists outcomes privately,
and marks uncertain dispatched runs for reconciliation. Kernel resume carries the last
confirmed native reference into the next turn. Restart recovery verifies retained text
under the native lock and does not dispatch another process. Readiness is supplied by a
trusted provider owner; ordinary configuration registration and account qualification
remain open. Workspace-completion and mailbox/topology tasks explicitly refuse until
their native receipt paths are implemented.

`GeminiTaskPreflight` now supplies the concrete readiness owner through the shared
durable ProviderPreflightService/PreflightCache. GeminiPreflight checks registered
settings/effective denial policy and CLI version before a fresh-session PONG request;
it never resumes the user's task session. Readiness binds model, runtime/settings/policy
identities and explicitly registered credential sources. Native quota/auth/model errors
invalidate the matching cache generation; no reset evidence means no automatic retry.
This is a registered host probe, not an isolated sandbox or proof that registration has
enumerated every possible native auth/execution branch. Ordinary configuration wiring,
complete native registration and account-backed acceptance remain open.

The candidate local runtime now registers `gemini` alongside other configured providers.
GeminiRegistration constructs preflight and task execution from the same explicit settings
profile, canonical session directory and registered credential sources. Session lookup is
bounded and validates the full native UUID/project; it never launches a model. Normal
queue dispatch and control recovery use this registration. Recovery bypasses readiness
and credential freshness so retained outcomes remain recoverable after credential rotation.
The current text profile refuses configured workflow/file/communication requirements;
their native receipt implementations, Viewer adoption, complete native runtime discovery
and real account acceptance remain required before claiming full Gemini support.

Responsibilities:

- discover and authenticate official provider CLIs;
- preserve provider-native process, liveness, timeout, streaming, and session behavior;
- normalize runtime events without letting product clients infer outcomes.

Key location: `controlmesh/cli/`.

Every provider-launch path carries one Python-issued `ExecutionContext` containing a
trace id, existing `Origin`, bounded `SourceScope`, transport, and a hashed source
reference.  The context is propagated through the orchestrator, MessageBus injection,
TaskHub/background persistence, cron/webhook one-shot execution, and recovery/resume.
`CLIService._make_cli()` and `infra.task_runner.run_oneshot_task()` are the two final
admission boundaries; both call the same source-aware policy evaluator before provider
construction or command building.

Group messages, bot handoffs, API requests, cron, webhook, and heartbeat work require a
confirmed Docker container.  If setup, recovery, image build, daemon access, or container
start fails, these sources fail closed and never fall back to a host provider process.
Explicit local foreground and direct-message compatibility remains host-compatible.  The
policy decision records normalized sandbox, tool, network, writable-root, and confirmation
posture without storing prompt text, credentials, absolute paths, or raw message IDs.

### Native Session Adoption

The enhanced terminal registers its own foreground CLI service with TaskHub and routes
background results/questions into its file-backed inbox, without a transport bot.

The local terminal `/tasks sessions <query>` reads the Linux/OpenCode source from History
Viewer on loopback port 8787. Candidate identities are cross-checked against the local
OpenCode SQLite store opened read-only. `/tasks inspect <id>` also works without Viewer.
`/tasks adopt` requires an explicit session ID, revision, native directory, target repository,
and provider/model. Only a runtime-issued local-foreground context may enter this path.

TaskHub persists a versioned `native_session` reference alongside its ordinary task identity,
execution context and tool grant. It checks identity/revision before admission and dispatch,
performs a supervised PONG model preflight, and passes the explicit session plus native cwd
to OpenCode. `AgentRequest.working_dir` changes execution cwd; `CLIConfig.runtime_home`
keeps CM environment/state ownership at the original runtime home. Host OpenCode commands
pass `--dir` explicitly so native event subscriptions bind to the execution directory.

Existing cancel/resume paths retain the native session and checkpoint after CM's own turn.
`/tasks recover --task <id> --revision <revision> -- <instruction>` handles stale tasks after
an owner crash: it requires a freshly inspected revision, checks both task and preflight
process leases, retains the original execution grant, and resumes the same TaskHub task.
Active-task checks and an advisory OS lease exclude concurrent CM runs. Other native clients
do not honor this lease: users must stop those clients before adoption. Revision checks detect
intervening changes but do not guarantee exclusion against an unrelated OpenCode process.

Viewer history is discovery evidence, native OpenCode owns conversation continuation,
SpecMesh owns project facts, and CM owns task lifecycle. Historical instructions do not
issue execution grants. The public HTTP/SDK surface stays read-only; container directory
mapping, remote adoption and other native providers are not supported by this first adapter.

### Messaging and Delivery

Responsibilities:

- authenticate and receive transport messages;
- map chats, topics, and users to sessions;
- arbitrate opt-in Feishu multi-bot groups before orchestration so coordinator, exact @,
  broadcast, passive observation, and bot-loop rules have one Python-owned decision seam;
- deliver foreground and background results through `MessageBus` envelopes;
- keep user-visible background output summarized and transport-aware.

Key locations:

- `controlmesh/messenger/`
- `controlmesh/bus/`
- `controlmesh/session/`

The domestic Feishu long connection runs one lifecycle per attempt generation: each
attempt owns its thread, event loop, SDK client, and ping timer, and startup timeout or
stop aborts exactly that attempt by cancelling its connect/ping tasks and joining its
thread. Event dispatch is generation-gated at both the SDK handler and the owner loop, so
a superseded or cancelled connection can never deliver to the owner loop, and a
superseded attempt's cleanup can never disconnect the attempt that replaced it.

### Memory, Workspace, and Artifacts

Responsibilities:

- own local path construction and persisted workspace layout;
- maintain file-backed user memory;
- resolve task folders and artifacts in Python;
- prevent traversal and symlink escape during artifact reads/downloads.

Key locations:

- `controlmesh/memory/`
- `controlmesh/workspace/`
- `controlmesh/api/artifact_access.py`

### Public Protocol and Product Layer

Responsibilities:

- define additive public payload shapes in JSON Schema;
- generate Python and TypeScript models deterministically;
- project Python state through authenticated read-only adapters;
- validate all public SDK JSON responses at runtime;
- render local read-only task, provider, topology, event, and artifact views.
- serve the compiled dashboard from the same local origin as `/api/v1`.

Dependency direction:

```text
JSON Schema
  -> generated Python models -> Python adapters/facade
  -> generated TypeScript models/validators -> SDK -> Web
  -> deterministic Web build -> Python wheel -> localhost /dashboard/
```

TypeScript never constructs private task or artifact filesystem paths.

## Data Flow

### Foreground Turn

```text
message or terminal input
  -> session lookup
  -> orchestrator flow
  -> provider CLI process
  -> normalized events/result
  -> session update and transport response
```

### Background Task

```text
task submission
  -> TaskHub persistence
  -> route/capability and safety gates
  -> provider-backed worker or topology runtime
  -> events/checkpoints/artifacts
  -> ask_parent + resume when needed
  -> summarized result delivery
```

### Read-only Product View

```text
Python history/task/provider read models
  -> protocol adapters
  -> authenticated /api/v1
  -> runtime-validating SDK
  -> local Web dashboard
```

## Important Invariants

- Python is authoritative for runtime behavior and persisted state.
- JSON Schema is authoritative for cross-language public shapes.
- Generated protocol files are never edited directly.
- Legacy `/catalog/*` response shapes remain backward compatible.
- Task statuses, persisted fields, provider/transport names, and relative paths remain
  stable without an approved migration.
- Read-only APIs do not instantiate mutation-capable registries merely to read data.
- Task events are filtered by authoritative task identity.
- Artifact paths stay relative; safe open uses Python-resolved persisted task directories,
  metadata allowlisting, descriptor-relative traversal, and no-follow semantics.
- Web/SDK code cannot read private ControlMesh files or own provider/transport execution.
- Standalone Alpha serving binds to `127.0.0.1`, registers no legacy upload/WebSocket
  mutation routes, and keeps the SDK surface read-only.
- High-risk routing and release/publish behavior stays foreground unless an explicitly
  trusted and approved worker contract allows it.
- Source-aware execution policy is evaluated immediately before provider admission;
  provider/model fallback cannot weaken a required sandbox boundary.
- `director_worker` and `debate_judge` use typed control decisions, bounded rounds, and
  explicit parent-input boundaries rather than transcript parsing.

## External Dependencies

- Official provider CLIs such as Claude, Codex, Gemini, and OpenCode.
- Messaging APIs for configured transports.
- Python/uv for runtime and tests.
- pnpm, Node, and Bun for protocol generation, SDK tests, and Web build/dev.
- Local files and OS process/service facilities for persistence and operation.

## Fragile Areas

- Provider auth discovery intentionally honors operator environment variables and XDG
  paths; tests that mock user homes must isolate ambient XDG configuration.
- Provider streaming, timeout, liveness, and recovery semantics require golden fixtures
  before any port.
- Task lifecycle mutations span persisted state, events, provider processes, delivery, and
  recovery; SDK smoke tests alone do not establish parity. The executable Python oracle at
  `tests/golden/runners/task_lifecycle.py` generates the versioned lifecycle matrix and CI
  checks it for drift. Its JSON Schema is the cross-language fixture-shape authority. The
  private `@controlmesh/runtime-facade` candidate consumes matrix inputs in memory; the
  dual-run gate compares every normalized observation, records JSON-path differences, and
  keeps Python as both production and rollback owner. It is not transport-facing.
- Result writeback and promotion safety is frozen by
  `tests/golden/runners/result_writeback_promotion.py`. Its ten normalized cases exercise
  production Python store/controller paths, and its committed Schema-validated fixture is
  checked for exact inventory and field drift by `pnpm test:golden`.
- Source-aware provider admission is frozen by
  `tests/golden/runners/execution_provenance_sandbox.py`. Its ten normalized cases cover
  trusted compatibility, every unattended/untrusted required scope, sandbox readiness,
  and denial before command construction. The fixture deliberately replaces generated
  trace/source identifiers with placeholders and contains no paths or sensitive input.
- Artifact download security depends on platform support for descriptor-relative no-follow
  opening and fails closed when unavailable.
- The dashboard stores a locally entered token in browser storage and must remain
  local-only until a separate remote-use security decision.
- Transport topic/thread mapping and retry semantics are platform-specific despite shared
  message envelopes.

### OpenCode quota failures

OpenCode enables native error logs on its own stderr. An opt-in one-shot executor observer classifies explicit quota exhaustion and terminates that process tree before native retry loops become generic timeouts. Quota metadata propagates through CLI, stream and agent results while existing task failure/delivery ownership remains unchanged. Provider-reported reset text is not assigned an invented timezone or used to schedule automatic account/model switching. Shared historical log files and assistant/tool output are not quota evidence.

Cron/webhook/background command construction now explicitly selects Claude, Codex, Gemini,
OpenCode or Claw; an unsupported SDK engine returns a typed error instead of running Claude.
The command owner applies grants after the provider's subcommand, preserves OpenCode prompts
over stdin, and classifies native completion independently of exit status. OpenCode one-shot
stderr quota records stop retries while preserving the reported reset and partial output.
Nonzero exits and cancellation retain their original cause; assistant/tool prose cannot be
used as quota evidence or as a substitute for a native completion event.

## Runtime migration (in progress)

Full runtime migration is now active in `plans/runtime-convergence/`. The private
`packages/controlmesh-runtime-core/` uses one coordinator-local SQLite transaction domain
for tasks, execution episodes, fencing leases, events, external-effect records, durable
mailboxes and command receipts. It imports strict offline TaskHub snapshots without
constructing the legacy registry or touching task folders. This kernel currently has no
production startup route; provider/transport ownership and `controlmesh_runtime` review/
promotion storage still belong to Python. Its database must not be shared over a network
filesystem. See the package README for implemented behavior and activation gates.

`RuntimeTopology` stores normalized topology checkpoints and parent-input interruption
state in candidate schema 17. It checks task ownership, task revision and its own topology
revision inside the command transaction. `team-topology.ts` owns state transitions;
the canonical `team-topology-state` schema and cross-field checks reject inconsistent
state before persistence. `readTeamTaskResult` decodes an explicitly bound, accepted
execution result. The queue below supplies the persisted role/phase assignment;
model self-labels cannot establish that binding.

`TopologyTaskQueue` now supplies that assignment for independently authorized local
children, stored in candidate schema 18. It atomically associates a checkpoint role
with a `LocalTaskRuntime` run and collects the run's accepted effect output. The kernel
checks the ancestor chain at admission and execution/publication boundaries; changed
checkpoints or inactive parents revoke child execution while lease-bound cleanup stays
available. The pipeline and fanout compositions below drive explicit local steps;
automatic service loops and device queue composition remain pending;
director/judge explicit dispatch is described below.

Candidate schema 19 adds assignment generations and prior-assignment history.
`TopologyTaskQueue.resume` archives the resolved assignment and reuses Kernel.resume
and the local queue in one transaction, preserving child task/native identity and
authorization across checkpoints. A new generation does not overwrite prior evidence.

`RuntimePipeline` composes accepted child output, Python-parity pipeline transitions
and local next-child enqueue/resume in a single command transaction. Each invocation
advances one explicit step; it does not run a background loop or create child grants.
Terminal queue transitions now use the sealed root-completion path below. A terminal
checkpoint alone still does not finish a parent. Service repair budgets and device
topology dispatch remain outside this pipeline composition.

`RuntimeFanout` composes bounded parallel admission and complete-batch result collection.
Workers retain one parent dispatch checkpoint until every assigned result is accepted;
their result envelopes use the Python collecting substage. Acceptance follows original
dispatch order and commits with reduction/next-task admission. Partial batches and queue
capacity failures roll back rather than revoking workers that are still executing.

`DirectorPolicy` and `JudgePolicy` port pure decision/checkpoint behavior against the
live Python runtimes. `RuntimeControlTopology` now composes them with accepted local
controller output and whole-batch worker collection. Candidate schema 20 adds
`topology_controls`: immutable controller task/role, parallel limit and per-task budgets.
A reopened service uses the original policy, not new process defaults. Generic topology
mutations reject managed control topologies, preventing an alternate checkpoint API
from bypassing the controller policy.

Control decisions must come from the assigned task's accepted episode/effect output;
role, substage and current decision round are checked against persisted state. Collection,
policy advancement and enqueue/resume share one command transaction. Repeated roles
retain their original task identity, with assignment generations preserving old evidence.
Judge repair keeps the formal round but uses only the latest candidate batch. The service
adds durable repair/interruption caps (default one each) beyond the Python pure judge
policy's formal-round limit; exhaustion records a terminal failure without another queue
admission. Original accepted decisions remain available in assignment history.

These are explicit local steps. They do not create child grants, run a background polling
loop, qualify a real-model topology or dispatch device workers. Full topology service
scheduling and native/device ownership gates remain open.

`topology-completion.ts` seals terminal queue reductions in candidate schema 21 and calls
`RuntimeKernel.completeTopology` inside the original transition transaction. The proof
binds the exact topology/checkpoint and current assignment results plus archived generation
metadata. Every current child's original accepted episode/effect output is re-read; a
resumed, queued, uncertain or changed child blocks closure. A bare checkpoint cannot
issue completion. Final status, result preview, monotonic fence, proof and terminal event
commit together; an event-write failure rolls back the topology and result collection.
The event explicitly identifies a topology reduction, with no fabricated provider episode
or native session. Existing DeliveryOutbox projection consumes it once after restart.

`TopologyArtifactGate` admits successful root file delivery only within a trusted local
workspace and exact registered file allowlist. It matches every parent requirement to a
current child's accepted native completion contract, read/write mode and content hash,
then checks current canonical files through the existing contained read implementation.
Device result packets cannot act as local file witnesses. Preparation binds parent/task
revisions, assignment generations, file metadata and profile authority; all are checked
again inside the terminal transaction. The private live permit cannot be reconstructed
from stored JSON, and a process restart requires read-only preparation again, without
rerunning a child. Failure still records a terminal outcome without a success permit.

For a SpecMesh-adopted file contract, the independent plugin's `check` operation must
still return the exact source path/hash and requirements. This verifies the declared file
delivery source. It does not assert reviewed project closeout: `verify_closeout` retains
`unknown` pending independent host review. A changed source invalidates preparation.

`RuntimeKernel.reopenTopology` creates an explicit new execution under the same completed
root TaskHub ID. Candidate schema 22 stores the prior terminal state, parent snapshot,
assignments, frozen controller configuration and completion result in `topology_runs`.
The archive digest is checked by `RuntimeTopology.inspectRun`. Archiving, monotonic task
and topology revisions/fence, clearing the current completion and emitting task.resumed
commit together. Cancelled, changed, ambiguous or unaccepted work cannot be reopened.
The event records topology_reopen as its source and does not invent a provider episode.
Normal local/coordinator controls expose this through `reopen_schedule`, bound to the
schedule, task and topology revisions. Archival and schedule activation commit together;
the next normal scheduler tick dispatches the frozen roles. Current native assignments
must be settled and owned. Repeated command receipts never reopen again, and cancelled or
blocked schedules use no implicit continuation. `inspect_schedule` includes execution IDs;
`inspect_schedule_run` reads their verified root archives through the same private surface.

Each assignment now carries its topology execution ID. Old roles retain their child IDs
and generation history, but cannot authorize effects, result collection or file completion
in a new execution, even when checkpoint names repeat. Existing explicit child resume
continues its native session. Pipeline/fanout may reopen to planning and explicitly dispatch;
`RuntimeControlTopology.reopen` also atomically admits the original controller/candidates.
Frozen budget limits and controller identity are preserved; a new explicit execution starts
fresh counters. A service restart alone never resets counters or starts a new execution.
Legacy completion digest shape is retained during the execution-ID column migration.

Candidate schema 23 distinguishes native and aggregate child assignments. Trusted
scheduling explicitly requests an aggregate; the assignment reserves the child before
initialization and binds its execution ID when its topology is created. An already started
child execution cannot be attached after the fact. Both kinds retain the same bounded
one-parent/cycle checks. Orchestration tasks are refused by the local native queue and
kernel claim before any provider input, including while an aggregate awaits initialization.

`readAggregateResult` recursively validates the child's sealed topology completion and
current descendants, with a depth/cycle bound. It maps the accepted reduction to the
parent's assigned worker role/substage and records topology source identity; it invents
neither a native episode nor a controller decision. Director/judge decision roles remain
native output boundaries. Parent finalization rechecks accepted aggregate evidence, so a
resumed descendant, changed completion or mismatched execution rolls back completion.
The artifact gate follows aggregate executions to actual native leaf file receipts and
rechecks current registered files. Summary text does not become file evidence.

An explicit aggregate resume archives/reopens and reassigns the same child in one parent
transaction. Assignment generations, child run history and native leaf sessions persist;
failed reassignment restores the complete old linkage. Prepared control executions use
`RuntimeControlTopology.dispatch` with their original frozen configuration. Parent
cancellation blocks descendant claims/effects/publication; cleanup may retain unknown
execution evidence instead of claiming that the work stopped successfully.

`TopologyTaskQueue.peek` and `peekDecision` validate the same current assignment and
native/aggregate evidence as collection, but write neither acceptance nor command receipts.
They are scheduler reads under existing execution ownership, not public inspection grants.
A later transition must collect and validate again inside its own transaction.

`TopologyTaskQueue.retry` is an explicit native recovery operation at the unchanged parent
checkpoint. Verified JSON/schema/role/round failures have a distinct `TeamOutputError`;
authority loss, corrupt execution evidence and unexpected exceptions cannot authorize a
new attempt. The rejected assignment and proof identity are archived before atomically
resuming/requeuing the same child. Native session, task scope and frozen controller policy
remain intact. A fixed ceiling of two explicit retries per child/parent execution survives
restart; ordinary accepted repair generations do not spend this recovery budget. Known
quota deadlines block early retries. Unstarted blocked work retries its original input and
rejects a replacement prompt; completed/failed native work requires an explicit new prompt.
Cancelled, uncertain, aggregate and already-valid results cannot use this recovery path.
Nothing in these helpers starts a polling loop or automatically retries a model. The
separately configured scheduler below owns automatic progression.

Pipeline/fanout result options also support finite repair and parent-interruption limits.
They count the existing execution checkpoints and terminate from host policy with the
actual latest result evidence. Unsupported worker control statuses remain rejected; omitted
limits preserve Python parity. The schedule registration owner freezes these optional limits across service instances;
the pure transition functions retain their original standalone defaults.

Generic provider resume still refuses completed orchestration tasks. Older candidates
reject schema 23; rollback requires a pre-upgrade database backup, never changing a
populated database version. Schema 24 adds local automatic scheduling, described below;
semantic project closeout and full native/device acceptance remain open. Schema 25 adds
device topology assignment as described below.

`TopologyScheduler` now owns bounded automatic local progression over an immutable graph
of already-authorized tasks. Schema 24 stores schedule identity, plan digest, state/revision
and fenced lease; a membership table prevents conflicting task registrations. Four local
topologies and nested aggregates use the existing atomic queue compositions. An aggregate
waits for actual parent dispatch. Model decisions cannot mint tasks, roles, grants or policy.

Normal `openLocalRuntime` configuration and the JSON-lines CLI expose registration,
activation/pause, inspection, explicit native retry and parent answers. Registration starts
paused; background execution and EOF keepalive require explicit configuration. Inspection
and unchanged polls do not produce user prompts or events. Kernel scheduled transitions
retain the actor's authorization while recording `origin:schedule` for automatic events.

A schedule lease serializes async preparation and transition admission. Actual task,
checkpoint, assignment and native effect checks still run at commit. Pause/replacement
owner fences stale artifact preparation; ordinary shutdown retains active plan state while
stopping its loop. Native execution stays with LocalTaskRuntime and its existing leases.
Blocked schedules survive restart; provider quota/unknown/cancelled outcomes are not
replayed automatically. Explicit malformed-result recovery preserves its two-retry ceiling.

The control and configuration contract is documented in
`plans/runtime-convergence/topology-scheduling.md`. These are private candidate interfaces;
there is no production installation/default switch. Schema 25 adds `DeviceTopologyRuntime`
behind the same composition interface. Immutable routes bind native tasks to the existing
authenticated device queues. Assignment/execution digests and the actual device episode are
revalidated when collecting and completing a topology. Kernel claim binds that episode
atomically and enforces the coordinator-wide admission cap across workers and restart.
Execution sources remain explicit; remote output never masquerades as a local run.

The ordinary device coordinator configuration and CLI own optional background progression;
workers retain their existing independent native lifecycle. Issued native sessions remain
on their original authorized device. Released or expired admission cannot be rediscovered;
explicit bounded recovery creates a new assignment under the original task identity.
Unknown work and revoked authority remain blocked. Automatic assignments record schedule
origin. Controlled HTTP/configuration/upgrade fixtures do not establish real native-model
acceptance. Optional coordinator `topology_scheduler.artifacts` supplies a canonical local
destination and exact device-to-workspace source mappings. TopologyArtifactGate reuses the
actual device run/episode/effect and portable completion proof, checks the native evidence
and handle, then matches current canonical file bytes. Remote witnesses are recorded with
their device/workspace/assignment identity and never become fabricated local runs. Files
must already be delivered; this is not an automatic file transport or remote-only workspace
verifier. Parent and leaf TaskHub repo_root identify the canonical destination. Existing
SpecMesh source checks and transactional preparation/commit checks remain required. Snapshot
paths are matched explicitly in contract order, rejecting symlink aliases. Older candidates
reject schema 25; rollback needs the prior backup.

Schema 26 adds `topology_native_inputs`: one bounded immutable context per native run.
The topology queue freezes the assigned role/stage, output schema, registered worker roles,
parent objective and prior checkpoint results in its dispatch transaction. The current
checkpoint can carry the preceding worker result (notably pipeline review), so that result
is included. Historical Agent output is explicitly distinguished from current file evidence.

A live assigned child lease can obtain only its own snapshot via `NativeMailboxDelivery`.
The derived handoff has schedule origin, no fabricated sender episode, and zero forwarding
hops. Existing native input/manifests/receipt verification prove consumption; no new provider
prompt or transport protocol bypass is introduced. Missing/corrupt context rejects claim;
device discovery hides it. Omitted delivery rejects native dispatch, and oversized context
blocks before another role is queued. Existing mailbox ordering and backpressure remain.
Older pending candidates without an issued context remain blocked for explicit migration
handling; completed evidence is retained. This is not authorization to reopen or replay them.

Claude local/device topology dispatch derives its optional native output contract only
from that attributed coordinator snapshot. The pinned CLI receives a self-contained Draft 7
generation schema after its vocabulary is checked for compatibility; result acceptance still
uses the original canonical protocol schema and frozen role/stage/round. StructuredOutput
is admitted only with this contract. Stream results and native JSONL tool receipts must agree;
schema validity alone cannot establish completion. A native structured_output attachment,
its matching tool call and successful receipt can close the native turn without a final
prose reply. This verified terminal also permits a later baseline/append on the original
session, including the pinned CLI's exact non-model synthetic resume pair. A successful
result may follow at most four invalid-schema rejections: each failed native receipt must
actually violate the frozen contract, and only the last call may succeed. Repeated success,
other errors, missing receipts and more than five attempts reject. Other pending tools or
unsupported attachments still reject. Canonical scheduler
text is derived from the verified object, retaining a digest of the CLI result text. Required
file reads, workspace publication, SpecMesh and completion gates remain independent.

Container control helpers are built in a separate supervised Bun process before provider
dispatch, with a ten-second limit and environment-file discovery disabled. Source/protocol/
lockfile digests are checked around the build; bounded private output is retained by hash
and temporary output is removed. Recovery reads retained helpers/evidence without building
or running a provider. This avoids sharing in-process bundler state with runtime SQLite.

`LocalTaskRuntime` adds the private local task execution owner. SQLite schema 8 stores
queued runs, their expected task revision and provider/profile binding, plus the claimed
episode and terminal outcome. Two controllers sharing the configured principal/device
share a persisted concurrency policy; claim and queue ownership commit in one transaction.
The pure resolver does not invoke a provider. Execution performs one durable preflight
before the actual native worker; inspection, submission and replay do not probe a model.
Blocked runs remain blocked until a new explicit request. Recovery consults original
episodes and never replays an uncertain native operation.

`scripts/local-runtime.ts` exposes this owner through bounded JSON-lines on stdin/stdout.
It requires an explicit private candidate configuration and isolated state directory,
refuses the known legacy state layout, and constructs the OpenCode adapter lazily. Only
`drain` advances execution; requests can inspect or cancel work while it is active. EOF
waits for already requested work but does not start queued tasks. This is not the installed
`cm` command or a production writer lock. Source/grant/principal authority comes from the
private configuration and issuance owner, never request body fields. Qualified local profiles
include OpenCode container reads and explicitly registered staged workspace writes. `tell` persists a pending mailbox message;
`inspect_message` and `mailbox_status` expose delivery state without running a model.
Other ingress/transport profiles are still separate work.

Optional local `history` registration composes the independent headless CLI with the existing
device_native_adoptions registry. Explicit refresh/search/prepare return context-only candidates;
submit resolves the opaque task/device/workspace/model-bound handle, then ordinary ingress and
execution owners issue current authority. Cache and native-source paths must be canonical and
disjoint. Web is not required. See the [local Claude adoption contract](../plans/runtime-convergence/claude-continuity-design.md#local-history-adoption-contract).

Optional trusted `workspace.write_roots` selects the staged write owner. Native containers
see private snapshots projected at original paths; the controller alone publishes canonical
changes. Version-2 native dispatch manifests retain write roots, stage basis and workflow
binding; original observations bind the sealed proposal and native file-tool evidence.
Version-1 read manifests remain supported. `WorkspaceStage`
uses per-file write-ahead journaling and fsync, with explicit partial-batch recovery rather
than batch atomicity. `inspect_reconciliation`/`reconcile_task` verify and apply the original
proposal without a new native invocation. Schema 13 reserves request identity before recovery
publication/asynchronous verification and atomically exchanges it for the completed receipt.
Current revision/grant/configuration/native/file checks remain mandatory. Normal device
startup and unsealed-result recovery ownership are still open; see the active native-write design.

`specmesh-port.ts` is an optional adapter to an explicitly registered independent SpecMesh
checkout. It pins package/Python/workspace identity, validates the external snapshot
capability and draft contracts, and supervises bounded read-only checks before native
preflight. The registered native required reads must already cover selected continuity
references; asserted links cannot issue grants. A checked observation is revalidated at
execution boundaries, never reused after restart as cached authority. The current read
profile stops if its continuity inputs change during execution. The local write profile
rechecks the independent snapshot after owned publication, before task completion. Required
read registration cannot expand from those changed documents, and structural pass is not
independently reviewed closeout. `prepare_handoff` and
`verify_specmesh` are private, task-scoped control operations with current revision/fence
checks. Unknown closeout never promotes task completion. Shutdown aborts and reaps pending
checks. This is a trusted optional command adapter, not a sandbox for arbitrary Python
plugins or a production writer switch; SpecMesh itself has no CM dependency.

The local `OpenCodeWorker` takes an ordered, bounded mailbox prefix for each native turn.
Schema 9 reserves those message IDs against the actual effect and immutable dispatch
manifest in the same transaction as execution dispatch. Sender/origin/sequence and payload
are encoded into attributed native input; they cannot change task source or grants. Only
verified native input plus a terminal reply permits consumption, atomically with effect
confirmation and task completion. Explicit native reconciliation applies the same input
verifier and reservation checks after a lost completion. Generic mailbox acknowledgements
cannot consume a reserved native delivery, and expiry cannot make uncertain dispatched
messages eligible for replay. Updates that arrive later or exceed the fitting prefix remain
pending; the result records their count. There is no automatic additional model turn.

An optional trusted per-task communication registration now adds native MCP send, ask_parent,
receive and answer. `NativeAgentBroker` serves one execution over a private Unix socket;
the compiled Node stdio client receives an episode-specific capability file. The container
mounts only that task's channel directory read-only. The native profile and readiness bind
the client digest and directory identity. Native permission inspection permits only the
four named tools, and the task's portable grants must also allow them. Source, sender lease,
parent and peer authority come from trusted registration, never model arguments.

Schema 10 journals logical tool request IDs before application. A completed duplicate
reuses its response under current authority; a lost in-flight call remains unresolved.
Bounded receive waits run outside transactions. Tool-delivered messages stay reserved until
actual native tool names, parameters and outputs match the journal. The broker stops
admission before verification; input-batch consumption precedes tool-message consumption,
effect confirmation and terminal task commit in one transaction. Explicit reconciliation
uses the original native records without launching a model. Real local OpenCode/M3 acceptance
covers all four tools between two Agents, existing parent-session recall and controller
reopen with zero replay calls. The device extension is described below; topology integration
remains open.

The private `OpenCodeWorker` now connects kernel leases/effect receipts to actual native
process supervision and terminal evidence. Its current profile is explicitly issued local
foreground work with literal read permissions; unknown source, unsupported network or
controller-approval restrictions are denied. History discovery uses an independent
headless Viewer CLI, followed by a local native-store v2 revalidation. Linux session
flocks interoperate with the old Python lock namespace. Result observations are persisted
before verification; only verified native lineage, output and required reads can confirm
an effect. Interrupted or inconsistent work remains unknown and cannot be auto-resumed.
This implemented private path does not switch any released transport/runtime owner.

OpenCode's shared `global` project row is not stable worktree authority: both a no-Git
preflight and an empty Git repository can rewrite it. CM resolves a global session's Git
root from its bound directory, uses `/` only for a proven non-Git directory, and rejects
broken Git discovery. Non-global sessions retain the native project worktree. Native
identity, resolved permission and current-read verification remain required afterward.

New private TS submissions use `TaskIngress`: configured channel provenance is separate
from `Principal.origin`, task bodies cannot issue grants, and task creation/source/grant/
authorization event/receipts share one transaction. Replays retain the original trace;
resume retains source/grant/reply identity. Async-local execution context isolates concurrent
tasks. The TS source-policy, provider-mapping and reply-identity ports are checked against
live Python owners. Provider mapping is not admission: source sandbox requirements and
controller confirmation must be enforced independently. The current OpenCode worker and
native reconciler validate the full persisted context and grant before using native state.
Released sandbox/provider launchers and transport delivery are still Python-owned.

`OneShotProviderProcess` is a private TS host-process owner for these five command shapes.
It independently builds commands and observes native JSON against the live Python oracle,
then uses the existing process supervisor with source/grant checks, workspace identity and
synchronous current-authority/readiness callbacks. Its caller must own provider readiness;
the class neither probes a model nor schedules work. Its optional `ContainerProcessSupervisor`
owns an actual per-execution container and verifies isolation before native launch; it does
not accept a container name as sandbox evidence. Production scheduler/TaskHub admission,
native session adoption, SDK engines and result delivery remain separate migration work. Fixture
process acceptance is not real model qualification for every listed provider.

The private container owner creates from an already available image digest on a local Linux
Docker engine with seccomp. A nonroot execution has a read-only root filesystem, no added
capabilities, no-new-privileges, private PID/IPC/cgroup namespaces and memory/CPU/PID limits.
The configured workspace, private control directory and explicitly selected device-local
native resources are mounted. Writable project roots use specific nested bind mounts; the
control directory and other project paths remain read-only. Native resource directories
cannot overlap the workspace or controller state. Read-only regular-file mounts can protect
credentials inside a writable native data directory; writable file mounts and other nested
resource directories are rejected.
Recursive submount copying is disabled. `no_network` selects an isolated network namespace
for the entire process, including its model client; it is not an HTTP allowlist.
The default `portable` workspace layout mounts at `/workspace`. A configured `native`
layout mounts only the same project and granted nested roots at their original absolute
paths, preserving provider directory identity. The plan binds that working directory;
Docker inspection and PID 1 both verify it before execution. Mounts that shadow the helper,
control lease, temporary home, kernel filesystems or image runtime paths are rejected.

A compiled TS helper runs as container PID 1 and checks a read-only lease file against the
Linux boot ID and suspend-aware uptime. Expiry or parent process completion ends that PID
namespace, including detached descendants. The host controller renews only while current
authority, grant, workspace and deadline checks hold. Per-execution records are versioned,
persisted before create and never reused for another invocation. Labels, nonce, image,
immutable container ID, socket and engine ID bind cleanup. An ambiguous create is reconciled
by observed identity; an absence check alone cannot close a create that may still be pending.
Cleanup cannot start an old execution. Unknown cleanup stays explicit, and expired recovery
is independently callable after the controller dies. Private launch material is removed only
after container removal is confirmed; records retain the execution's no-replay marker.

`OpenCodeReadContainerRunner` connects the existing preflight and local/device native driver
to this owner. It preserves the original project and native data/cache paths, mounts only the
OpenCode subdirectories, and overlays `auth.json` read-only. HOME, configuration and incidental
state stay in the container's temporary home. Its runtime digest binds the image/profile and
resource identities in both the readiness cache and native dispatch manifest; host-only
readiness or another runtime cannot admit that execution. A changed resource requires an
explicitly reconstructed profile and matching preflight. Provider credential revision remains
separately bound. It does not mount the legacy CM home or automatically adopt sessions.

Real x64 OpenCode 1.18.29/M3 acceptance covers this read profile in a Git-capable pinned image:
trusted TaskIngress, real model preflight, original native session continuation after coordinator
and runner reopen, headless Viewer revalidation, required current-file reads and confirmed
kernel results. Other provider/write/source profiles, production startup and writer cutover
remain required; this adapter does not widen the local read driver's source policy.

The private `DeviceCoordinator` now exposes a separate loopback worker protocol with
credentials mapped to trusted device registrations. Tasks have persisted, digest-bound
assignments to capabilities and logical workspaces; physical paths and executable
adapters stay on each device. Durable revocation survives coordinator reconstruction.
The worker's `runProcess` supplies a suspend-aware lease deadline to the Linux process
anchor. Request replay never restores expired execution authority, and completion commits
the effect/result receipt atomically. Explicit peer assignments allow cross-device
mailbox exchange without granting execution access to the peer task. This transport has
real x64/ARM64 native read/write/recovery evidence; other provider fleet
profiles and production startup remain gated by the active plan.

`OpenCodeExecution` shares native preparation and verification between `OpenCodeWorker`
and `OpenCodeDeviceAdapter`. The latter keeps preflight, native store/locks and full evidence
on its executing device; `DeviceExecutionJournal` binds the original assignment,
job/workspace and native manifest. The coordinator receives digest references and a bounded
result with an opaque native session handle. Cross-task/episode/reference mismatches are
rejected before completion. The original device resolves that handle after restart; kernel
resume preserves the task's original source and grant while worker events stay agent-origin.

Optional device `write_roots` are resolved only through the trusted local workspace map.
The staged runner keeps canonical project files non-writable to the native process. Full
write manifests and retained proposals stay in the device journal; wire references carry
only a profile digest/workflow binding and a matching bounded publication proof. Normal
completion and recovery both reject missing/substituted proofs. Publication serializes an
explicit coordinator renewal with heartbeat updates; recovery re-fetches its existing
challenge. Local monotonic deadline/scope checks guard each journaled file operation. The
optional independent SpecMesh check runs before preflight and after publication. Failures
remain uncertain and do not rerun the model. Already-applied files can precede later remote
cancellation; no instantaneous distributed revocation or multi-file atomicity is asserted.
`scripts/device-runtime.ts` now constructs a private coordinator or native worker from
explicit local configuration. Its shared bounded stdin/stdout transport supports task
creation/assignment, current task/effect inspection, cancellation/revocation and original
challenge recovery. `DeviceWorker` resolves a locally registered Adapter factory for the
authenticated task; recovery uses the integrity-checked retained job. Native task/peer/parent
profiles stay distinct across assignments. Configuration changes fence incoming admission
and in-flight native communication; controlled shutdown interrupts owned execution.
Worker run IDs are reserved transactionally before asynchronous work. Concurrent duplicate
requests share one result; a reservation left by a previous process cannot restart a model,
and a completed ID cannot execute a later task revision. See the package's
`DEVICE-RUNTIME.md` for the private contract. Full operator product integration and installed
production startup remain separate rollout requirements.

`DeviceScheduler` persists discovery and attempts in additive candidate schema 15. The
coordinator's explicit assignment generation supplies stable work identity across incidental
task revisions; paginated discovery prevents a bounded first page from hiding later work.
One device-local elapsed-time/boot-bound lease owns automatic admission. The existing worker
and native/file/message guards check its generation alongside coordinator authority; new manual
runs cannot bypass its concurrency budget. Restart retains unknown outcomes for original-effect
reconciliation, rather than rerunning a task. Only evidenced pre-execution provider reset dates
enable timed retries; cache probe budgets and explicit private operator resets remain separate.
Daemon mode starts scheduling or coordinator expiry maintenance independently of the human Web
and stdin lifetime. A persisted pause survives restart; no human conversation or cron is used.

The optional worker-local History adapter invokes the independent headless CLI. It prepares
an immutable native reference in candidate schema 14's `device_native_adoptions` registry,
bound to principal/device/task/workspace/capability and the local configuration. Only its
opaque context digest travels to the coordinator, which issues task authority separately.
Execution checks native model/directory/content before preflight; interrupted-turn recovery
verifies the original appended turn without replacing its baseline. Completion transitions
to the existing result-ledger handle. Neither discovery nor selection starts the Web UI or
spends a model call. Normal runtime setup and operations are documented in `DEVICE-RUNTIME.md`.

ClaudeSessionStore/ClaudeHistoryClient add a separate JSONL identity and headless candidate
revalidation seam. They bind original file/device/session/workspace and hash all raw bytes,
including metadata and unknown fields. This strict continuation reader is independent of
History's tolerant display parser. The existing one-shot Claude profile still disables
persistence; native runtime execution/preflight/recovery integration remains under migration.

Unstarted preparation failures can release an effect-free lease and return a typed reason;
expired unstarted admissions return to waiting. Started/uncertain effects cannot use this
release path. Original device observations are persisted before transport even if connectivity
was lost. `DeviceReconciliation` handles the missing acknowledgement through a persisted,
short-lived trusted request. Its challenge binds the unknown episode, fence, task revision,
assignment, original manifest, execution projection and registered device. The worker's
`reconcile(challengeId)` only invokes the configured adapter's native evidence verifier;
it acquires no execution lease and cannot launch a model. The same native/file/grant verifier
serves local and device recovery, holding the local session lock through report delivery.

Schema 7 adds coordinator recovery requests and durable acceptance receipts. An authenticated
device report retains agent provenance; a recovery-origin acceptance consumes the earlier
trusted request. The original observation, confirmed result, terminal task and receipt commit
atomically, including when the original observation never reached the coordinator. Existing
observations cannot be replaced. Cancellation, expiry, changed task/assignment/configuration,
registration changes and revocation reject acceptance. An exact lost-acknowledgement replay
returns a receipt and completes the matching local evidence record without executing again.
This verifies device attestations at their reporting boundary; independently modified native
stores/workspaces or a compromised authenticated device are not made trustworthy by transport
authentication. Native evidence and credentials remain on the original device.

Device-native MCP uses the same private `NativeAgentChannel` as the local broker. Its
backend forwards only fixed-effect, current-lease calls through the authenticated worker
client; the native client never receives device credentials. The coordinator binds the
communication scope to trusted assignment peers/parent and the original manifest reference.
Its existing native call journal owns messages and reservations. Device results carry
bounded call hashes derived from actual native tool parts; completion and recovery compare
every receipt to that journal before atomically consuming messages. Full native histories
stay in the device evidence ledger. Long receives wait outside transactions and recheck
revocation/assignment/lease authority; completed duplicates never repeat sends.

Device initial input uses the existing native mailbox owner: read a bounded ordered prefix
before preflight, retain the full batch device-locally, and send only IDs/digest with the
dispatch reference. The coordinator reconstructs and reserves the exact current prefix
atomically with dispatch. Verified native user-input evidence consumes this batch before
later MCP deliveries during completion or reconciliation. Lost dispatch acknowledgements
stay uncertain unless the coordinator proves the episode has no effects and fences it
before release. Broader provider/fleet profiles and production activation remain open.

Native dispatch and recovery share a persisted evidence boundary. Before execution,
`OpenCodeWorker` commits a bounded manifest with the effect intent: source/provider/grant
binding, native session baseline, resolved permission evidence and file fingerprints. Original
observations remain separate from accepted results. `NativeReconciler` independently checks
that evidence under the native lock and passes a synchronous verifier to the kernel's
revision/digest-bound acceptance transaction. It has no model/CLI invocation path. Only the
qualified local read profile is supported; missing historical manifests and incomplete tool
evidence remain unknown. Other runtime/store/profile recovery and production cutover remain
in the convergence plan.

## Private TS terminal delivery

The candidate `scripts/cm-runtime.ts` entry connects to a persistent local Unix-socket
service (`local-runtime-service.ts` / `runtime-control-socket.ts`). It uses the existing
LocalTaskRuntime, LocalRuntimeControl and SQLite owners. Client lifetime does not own task
execution; concurrent requests allow cancellation during asynchronous work. A descriptor
flock fences the listener before profile startup, and stale sockets require connection
refusal plus identity checks before removal. Task/event reads stay bounded and retain kernel
authorization and provenance. The normal command path and limits are in the
[local service runbook](../plans/runtime-convergence/local-control-service.md). This adds no
public mutation API, installed default switch or completed interactive-terminal claim.

`delivery-outbox.ts` owns terminal-result projection and uncertain transport outcomes;
`feishu-delivery.ts` and `telegram-delivery.ts` provide transport-specific adapters. Schema 11 retains explicit task routes,
event-based pending delivery, dispatch attempts, original acknowledgements and accepted
remote receipts. Kernel terminal events remain durable, allowing projection after restart
without rerunning execution. Routes derive destinations from issued reply grants and pin
source/adapter identity. There is no cross-transport broadcast fallback, model injection or
automatic resend of an uncertain outcome.

The private local entrypoint optionally configures one selected Feishu or Telegram text adapter; tasks
still require explicit route binding. Execution completion and delivery completion remain
distinct. Recovery can accept a retained original acknowledgement after matching current
authority and the original send evidence; it does not claim fresh remote readback.
An unobserved send stays unknown. A 128-record
unresolved queue, four shared dispatch slots and per-task ordering bound work. Shutdown
drains HTTP before storage closes. HTTP/SIGKILL tests use loopback and fixture credentials.

Schema 40 retains private attachment bytes in `delivery_media`. Telegram's optional
`delivery.media_roots` grants canonical local roots for `<file:/absolute/path>` selections.
Independent `delivery.media_device_artifacts: true` enables `<artifact:relative/path>`
selections from the accepted device execution attached to the terminal event. No local
root is required for device artifacts, and remote paths never become local filesystem
authority. The device inbox verifies current task revision, confirmed execution, principal,
completion contract and full content hash before capture. Existing device transfer bounds
(4 MiB/file, 16 MiB/execution) remain distinct from the 50 MiB local media profile.
Projection atomically stages the complete text/file group; confirmed send or original-ack
recovery releases its send copy, while an unknown send retains bytes without replay.
This Telegram integration does not imply media parity for other transports.

Telegram `/stop` is a runtime control command, never a model prompt. `TelegramInbox`
handles it before ordinary queued input, scoped to the authenticated bot/chat/topic and
current conversation task. The shared ingress pump invokes the optional control path
even while awaiting native execution, allowing cancellation to abort the active controller.
Older queued input/callbacks are retained as blocked; a late stop cannot supersede newer
applied input or continuation callbacks. Ordinary inbox capacity stays 128 with one
additional reserved stop slot. Commands addressed to another bot are ignored. This does
not implement the Python model/cron/session/task management selector menus.

Schema 41 `telegram_control_replies` owns responses that do not correspond to task
results, initially no-op `/stop`. Each reply binds an authenticated inbox request and
bot/chat/topic target; it creates no task or model invocation. Dispatch is journaled
before HTTP. Unknown sends are never replayed; a retained original acknowledgement can
be explicitly accepted through the inbox retry operation. A full 128-record unresolved
reply queue leaves a deferred response marker without rolling back the stop, and drains
that response after capacity returns. Inbox status exposes deferred/unresolved replies
separately from Agent execution. The initial control transport does not auto-retry rate
refusals; full management menus and transport parity remain in the migration plan.

Schema 42 classifies read-only `/tasks` requests separately from execution input. Its
ten-item pages use active delivery routes for the selected bot/principal/chat/topic,
revalidate current task grants, and expose a cursor through `/tasks after <task_id>`.
The stored response carries observation time and omits prompts and filesystem paths.
Read-only views neither supersede older execution input nor block later input at reply
capacity. The control response pump runs independently of native execution; status can
arrive while an Agent remains active. Unsupported `/tasks` arguments produce usage text,
not a model request. Management mutation buttons remain unimplemented.

`feishu-credentials.ts` owns selected self-built-app tenant-token refresh. The profile loader
uses descriptor-checked private files, never credential discovery. Tokens are memory-only,
refresh is shared within one instance, expiry is monotonic, and credential rotation invalidates
cached/prepared credentials. Authentication failures latch; transient failures cool down.
Explicit blocked-delivery retry may reset the auth latch but never replay an uncertain send.
Private startup can retain an externally supplied token file or opt into app-secret refresh.

Reply targets are trusted per-task startup configuration or a registered inbox resolver,
and their binding is part of adapter identity.
Control derives the task's reply thread/grant from this profile; the adapter reads the
original message before a dedicated reply POST and checks chat/parent/root/topic in the
acknowledgement and later recovery. Existing-topic and quoted replies are covered by local
HTTP tests. The stdio owner stops runtime, transport and credential operations together;
expected signal-induced input closure is not a startup failure. Media/new-topic creation,
user/marketplace auth, other adapters and production ingress/cutover remain in the plan.

`feishu-event-auth.ts` verifies original event bytes and normalizes allowlisted human text
messages. `feishu-inbox.ts` owns schema-12 event aliases and conversation-to-task mapping.
An HTTP acknowledgement follows persistence; atomic application creates/resumes, binds and
queues the task. Follow-ups wait for active execution and retain its native session. The
reply resolver validates the immutable opening event against issued source/reply authority.
`feishu-inbound-runtime.ts` runs a bounded loopback listener and event-driven work pump,
including queued-work recovery before releasing a conversation's next message. Blocked
conversations do not monopolize the batch. `scripts/serve-feishu.ts` is the headless owner;
Web is not involved in execution or message exchange. The verified source remains direct/
group message throughout admission. Only the actual container runner provides remote read
execution; group controller approval cannot be waived by transport admission.

Container preparation checks the current task authorization and total deadline at each
step. The one-second in-container execution heartbeat starts immediately before launch,
after the durable launch marker, so slow preparation does not expire a process that does
not exist yet. Once armed, an expired heartbeat cannot renew; SIGSTOP/SIGKILL acceptance
still requires native work to stop and recovery to avoid restarting it.

## Codekit integration (v0.43.0)

The private TypeScript device path supports opt-in completion-file delivery through
`DeviceArtifactInbox` and `uploadDeviceArtifacts`. Database 27 persists bounded chunks and
logical receipts, tied to the native manifest and assignment; accepted task output is the
only source of read authority. Normal execution uploads under its lease; interrupted upload
recovery uses the existing expiring reconciliation challenge, without another native turn.
Receiving bytes is separate from canonical workspace publication. The coordinator's optional
`publish_received` artifact profile delegates that second authority to `TopologyPublication`.
Before initial child dispatch, database 28 binds a sparse `WorkspaceStage` baseline to the
parent revision, execution and profile. Accepted device evidence selects exact write files;
the existing stage journal seals and publishes them under a current scheduler lease. Local
changes conflict, unrelated files remain outside the snapshot, and restart resumes the same
proposal without rerunning a provider. Each file replacement is durable; a multi-file result
is not an atomic filesystem transaction. SpecMesh requirements are checked before and after
publication, while reviewed project closeout remains separate. Configuration, limits and the
local artifact read command are in the [device runbook](../plans/runtime-convergence/topology-scheduling.md).

See [CODEKIT-INTEGRATION](CODEKIT-INTEGRATION.md) for the new module boundary, public invocation and limits. This local implementation does not establish deployment acceptance.

The candidate readiness cache now consumes a provider-neutral report while retaining its
persisted shape and OpenCode compatibility type. ClaudePreflight/ensureClaude supply a separate
qualified zero-tool native probe and credential-environment binding. Actual init/assistant/result
records qualify readiness, not a historical session title or model-auth file. The common cache
owns probe permits, expiry, quota reset waiting and explicit operator retry; native execution
must still qualify its own grant/container/workspace profile before using readiness.

Claude's verified `system/api_retry` event stops the owned native process before its next
attempt. Only replay of the initialized, session-bound control stream can classify that
failure and revoke the matching readiness generation. SDK backoff is not provider reset
evidence; unknown errors remain provider errors. A failed or uncertain task cannot become
completed through this health update. Workspace MCP reads advertise an initial request
without a hash and subsequent pages bound to the returned SHA-256. A mismatched read
returns correction guidance while retaining its failed receipt and requiring a new request
ID for changed arguments; file consistency and full-read acceptance are unchanged.

The private local candidate also registers ClaudeTaskAdapter/ClaudeTaskReconciler independently
of OpenCode. A distinct Claude dispatch manifest binds the current task/native JSONL baseline to
scoped file tools and the existing stage. Fsynced raw process output precedes its compact kernel
observation; normal completion and explicit recovery share the same source/tool/publication
verifier. Recovery never invokes a provider. Claude parallel tool-result edges must bind to the
exact pending call owner; they do not permit arbitrary history branches. A pinned max-turns
attachment with no outstanding tools is a resumable failure boundary. Only its exact native
synthetic resume pair is skipped as padding; a new explicit input and actual model completion
are still required, and the failed turn cannot be reconciled as success. Optional SpecMesh start
and publication checks remain separate from semantic closeout. See the active
[Claude continuity design](../plans/runtime-convergence/claude-continuity-design.md) for qualified
profiles and the remaining peer/adoption/device boundaries. Production remains Python-owned.

A verified terminal Claude turn can still fail its task contract. Missing mandatory reads
produce `native_task_failure.v1` only after identity, native input, source and every tool
receipt pass, and only without write staging or communication authority. Local and device
completion/reconciliation retain the original session and missing relative paths, confirm
the observed effect, and finish the task as `failed`. Artifact and SpecMesh success claims
are omitted. Device workers check the receipt status against their retained result; the
scheduler settles this execution without automatically retrying it. Uncertain execution,
unverified writes/messages and other providers retain their existing reconciliation rules.

Claude's local candidate now composes the separate workspace MCP channel and existing task
communication broker. Native control verifies both exact tool tables before input; each message
call retains the fixed task/episode/fence scope and durable journal response. Original JSONL
message calls and file calls are verified separately, then message consumption and task completion
commit together. Retained recovery consumes only verified existing rows and never starts a broker
or model. This local peer profile does not establish remote Claude or concurrent-write topology
qualification; the active continuity design owns those remaining gates.

Optional local `claude.container` selects the concrete container readiness/control owner without
host fallback. The normal task manifest pins the retained control helper and exact supervisor
execution identities. Completion and recovery verify removed-container outcomes before staged
publication; recovery reads original helper bytes without rebuilding from current source.
Claude turn limits count actual model/tool-use rounds in both streamed blocks and original JSONL,
not the provider's reported num_turns counter. This local container path has native continuation
and publication-loss recovery evidence; device Claude admission remains in the active plan.

### Candidate backstage event storage

The TS runtime's schema-30 `backstage_events` table stores session-scoped events separately
from task lifecycle `events`. `RuntimeEventStore` requires a principal on every operation
and makes event-ID replay idempotent within that principal. Session keys preserve typed
string versus integer identity, including large decimal terminal IDs. This is an internal
candidate owner; legacy JSONL import and production producer cutover remain pending in
`plans/runtime-convergence/`.

Backstage JSONL import/export uses an event-specific lossless integer codec. Internal
records may contain bigint; callers must use `exportJsonl` for serialization. A batch
binds one principal/session and rolls back on malformed input or conflicting event IDs.
The task kernel's JSON codec and public protocol types remain separate.

The TS kernel projects bounded task.* lifecycle summaries into backstage events in the
same transaction, using validated execution-context transport and task address. A stored
database source UUID namespaces event IDs. Local control exposes principal-bound
`session_events` as lossless JSONL with a bounded record limit; legacy partial contexts
remain task-only events. Other Python event producers are still pending migration.

### Candidate host-job persistence

Schema 31 stores host jobs separately in principal-scoped `host_jobs`. HostJobStore uses
existing receipt transactions, revision checks and terminal merge rules; job workspace
and source bindings remain fixed. This internal store does not dispatch commands or
trust imported PID/approval metadata. See runtime-convergence for remaining import,
execution and reconciliation owners.

### Candidate process output storage

Schema 32 adds append-only process_output_chunks keyed by execution effect and ordered
by sequence. Host supervision persists decoded chunks before terminal output acceptance;
content digests include effect, stream and sequence. This output is observational only: it
never confirms an effect or completes a task. An unavailable/synchronous-contract-violating
output sink stops the supervised process with output_sink_failed.

The host_log control/CLI reads bounded, principal-owned pages without following stored
filesystem paths. Noninitial cursors bind the effect. Process lifetime/lease authority
still belongs to ProcessSupervisor and the existing kernel; stored partial logs do not
prove an orphaned process stopped or enable resuming it. Previous TS binaries capped at
schema 31 reject this database version; rollback requires a compatible snapshot/runtime.


### Candidate bounded host lease renewal

Schema 33 persists episode_deadlines independently of renewable lease_until. Claims can
supply a maximum duration up to one day; omitted budgets and migrated episodes retain
their original expiry. Host renewals through either kernel entry point require the same
principal/device/current episode and cannot exceed that deadline or revive cancellation.
Device renewal without a host task keeps its existing protocol semantics.

An explicit trusted host.timeout_ms config enables local renewal, bounded by that budget.
The local owner renews through internal events and updates its durable run proof atomically;
its supervisor still verifies current authority and stops on disconnect or lease loss.
This does not provide detached process adoption. Rollback from schema 33 requires a
compatible runtime or a pre-upgrade snapshot, never deleting tables from live state.


Trusted host.environment adds bounded explicit process variables over the fixed PATH/LANG
baseline. Constructors snapshot and freeze this configuration; task payloads do not supply
it and controller environment is not implicitly inherited. Queue binding and execution
manifest contain its digest, not the variable map. Retained-result recovery requires the
same environment digest; older manifests without it represent only the historical default.


### Candidate detached host execution owner

Explicit host.detached registers a private worker launch after a local host run is claimed.
The manager persists a random host-transfer owner; the independent worker atomically swaps
that owner for its own identity only while the same run/binding/lease is current and the
episode is still leased. Duplicate transfers cannot execute. The worker opens the same
trusted configuration without auto-starting its topology scheduler and reuses perform,
HostJobProcess, renewal, logs, workflow and outcome persistence. No command/environment is
passed in process arguments; the private stdin transfer selects only an existing run.

Management shutdown leaves these workers running; explicit kernel cancellation still
revokes their authority. The ordinary anchor disconnect rule stays intact if the worker
itself dies. Unknown worker-launch outcomes are left leased for recovery, never retried
blindly. A manager drain does not await another process's active map: inspect the durable
run/task for completion. Full worker-death/launch-gap and deployment gates remain open.


After a detached host run finishes successfully, an authenticated plan-derived approval
permits scoped queue advancement for that exact plan approval ID. Plan receipt verification,
predecessor effect confirmation and expected revisions remain mandatory. The owner runs
only queued host steps bearing that approval ID and does not drain unrelated work.
An active management service can race the same queue; transactional claim and deterministic
step IDs retain one owner per execution. Other task/provider scheduling stays management-owned.


Telegram's candidate text profile uses an explicit private bot credential file, numeric
chat identity and strict sendMessage acknowledgement validation. Unknown sends remain
unknown across restart and never automatically replay. Schema 34 scopes remote message uniqueness by transport and chat while preserving existing
receipt and route identities. Unlike Feishu, Telegram cannot provide generic message
readback; its explicit recovery path accepts only the already-retained original successful
acknowledgement, without HTTP or credentials. This does not assert current remote content.
Schema 35 projects multipart text atomically into ordered per-part records. Each part has
its own attempt and acknowledgement; an uncertain prefix stops its suffix across restart.
The group digest binds part order/content identities, and private `delivery_groups` reports
completion only after every expected part is sent. Pure text projection needs no credentials
or network. Rich formatting, inbound/file/streaming and rate-limit parity remain open in
`plans/runtime-convergence/`. The production Python transport is unchanged.


The candidate Telegram text webhook path uses `telegram-event-auth.ts` and `telegram-inbox.ts`.
Schema 36 owns update aliases, chat-scoped message dedupe and durable topic conversations.
Authentication/policy precede persistence; HTTP acknowledgement follows successful persistence. Applying
an event creates/resumes and enqueues transactionally with current source/grants. Quota-blocked
runs retain subsequent input; late or pre-cancellation input cannot rewrite executed context.
The shared `WebhookInboundRuntime` supplies bounded loopback serving and an event-driven pump;
its Feishu class alias remains compatible. The schema 37 polling owner shares normalization and the queue pump, persisting raw batches
and offsets before confirmation. A local lease/generation fences late replies; stop aborts
long polling. Remote webhook presence/auth conflicts pause rather than trigger mode takeover.
Non-text profiles and cross-device ingress rollout remain open.

### Host command source policy

Approved HostJob routing, launch and recovery use `enforceHostJobSource`, the host-only
Python-compatible execution policy. Native-provider capability floors are separate. A
source requiring isolation is rejected because this launcher has no sandbox. Passing
that decision does not replace issued provenance, explicit step approval, tool grants,
workspace identity, lease fencing or imported-task reconciliation.

### Local external-controller host jobs

Python `runtime/host_job_bridge.py` and `cli_commands/hostjob.py` expose local
`hostjob run|wait|consume|status` over the existing HostJobRunner and AgentInboxStore.
One attempt has an explicit parent, command/workspace/provenance binding and dispatch
intent. A per-job OS lock serializes cooperating same-host bridge callers. Corrupt or
missing bindings beside prior job records or execution artifacts reject implicit
adoption. This is not cross-device election or an authenticated remote shell endpoint.

Wait reconciles exit evidence without relaunching. Unknown worker fate returns a review
status; a vanished wrapper preserves unknown child-process quiescence. Terminal event
consumption is locally at-most-once (mark before return), not the full Agent mailbox's
at-least-once delivery requirement. Status snapshots distinguish running from terminal.
The bridge issues only local-foreground provenance; it does not grant native tool access
or prove scheduled-source isolation. CM's internal parent name `main` is not an external
Codex desktop task. An active controller must retain a run/wait return channel: artifacts
on disk do not wake an idle conversation. Run controllers from a fixed installed version
or frozen snapshot while workers modify the framework checkout.

### TypeScript cron persistence and recurrence

Runtime schema 43 adds CronStore definitions, archival state, logical occurrences,
execution attempts, dependency locks and coordinator epochs. Archived definitions retain
execution lineage; restoration advances definition revision. Raw imported user JSON is
stored separately from internal revision/fence metadata. Cron migration is offline and
transactional; it is not a production synchronization writer. Snapshot export reads one
SQLite transaction and publishes with an exclusive sibling-temp link.

cron-schedule.ts computes bounded civil-time occurrences without timers or provider calls.
Repeated civil slots bind to fold 0 to prevent fixed-job replay after restart; the Python
oracle records original timer behavior separately from this TS policy. Five-field grammar
is currently supported; six-field legacy inputs require explicit migration resolution.
The scheduler execution owner, scheduled-source sandbox/grants, quota circuit and delivery
integration remain pending. Python remains the live cron owner until rollout acceptance.

CronScheduler now provides an explicitly started, abortable model-free loop over bounded
enabled jobs. Versioned per-job cursor metadata binds definition revision/digest and
resolved timezone. It plans forward on initial activation, retains one pending occurrence
while a dependency is busy, and limits recovery to one saved slot per job per tick before
planning from current time. Quiet and overlapping slots are retained as skipped records.
CronTaskAdmission submits through TaskIngress with schedule/cron provenance and bounded
persisted FIFO dependency waits; it does not launch a provider. Optional LocalTaskRuntime
binding atomically registers new tasks in the execution queue, rolling back on queue-full.
Candidate local service enables this through `cron_scheduler: { generation: N }` with
optional `user_timezone`, `host_timezone`, and `max_jobs`. The coordinator must already
be explicitly registered for the configured principal at generation N; opening a profile
never bootstraps or rotates authority. Host worker profiles do not start cron. The service
ticks scheduling even while its execution drain is pending, retaining source/container
checks. Native result reconciliation and delivery remain required before production cron.
