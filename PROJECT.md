# ControlMesh Project Context

## Why

Official coding CLIs are powerful but usually tied to one foreground terminal session.
ControlMesh turns them into a local-first, persistent task runtime that can be reached from
a terminal or chat, continue work in the background, coordinate multiple agents, ask for
missing information, recover after interruption, and deliver results back to the original
conversation.

Google CLI direction (confirmed 2026-09-13): AGY is the user's forward Google runtime.
Keep historical Gemini IDs/session formats as explicit compatibility profiles; do not
alias AGY to the old executable or retry retired personal-account CLI endpoints. Routine
implementation/testing is delegated to locally configured CBC/AGY; the primary Codex
controller owns task dispatch and acceptance. Preserve actual native session IDs, durable
results and distinct scheduled/agent/human provenance through CM's parent/task mechanisms.

## User Intent

The product should let a user move naturally between local terminal work and long-running
chat-native work without losing context or handing control of private project state to a
remote platform.

The important user outcomes are:

- `cm` must offer a polished terminal workbench comparable in interaction quality to
  Codex: discoverable commands, editable input, visible execution, interruption and
  session recovery; a line-oriented chat shell is not an accepted finished product;
- official Claude, Codex, AGY, OpenCode, CBC, and configured provider CLIs remain the actual
  execution engines;
- tasks have stable identities, persistent state, artifacts, interruption, resume, and
  result-delivery behavior;
- Feishu is the native/runtime-first transport, with Telegram and WeChat as important
  supported paths;
- existing Feishu application bots can be bound to native mode directly; onboarding must
  distinguish creating/binding an app from choosing native/bridge runtime behavior;
- multi-agent work is explicit, bounded, inspectable, and coordinated through shared
  runtime primitives;
- project and task knowledge survives a new terminal, a new agent, or a long gap without
  requiring the user to explain everything again;
- the user spends attention on intent and judgment, while agents handle exploration,
  implementation, tests, review, and memory maintenance.

## Non-goals

- Do not replace official provider CLIs with a proprietary model runtime.
- Do not treat a TypeScript facade or a wrapper around Python as a completed runtime migration.
- Do not let the Web UI or SDK read or write private ControlMesh files directly.
- Do not expose a remote-first dashboard, arbitrary shell endpoint, or arbitrary file read.
- Do not infer orchestration topology from prose; topology selection remains explicit.
- Do not add process documents, agent roles, evidence systems, or empty structures without
  a real need.
- Do not make conversation history the source of project truth.

## Success

ControlMesh succeeds when a user can start or resume real provider-backed work from the
terminal or a supported chat, let it run persistently, answer task questions, inspect
status and artifacts, recover from interruption, and receive a trustworthy result without
breaking existing workspaces or transport behavior.

The project-memory system succeeds when a new agent can read `AGENTS.md`, this file, the
relevant architecture/decision links, and one active task directory, then continue work
without loading the whole repository or asking the user to repeat established context.

## Constraints

Development knowledge is an optional planning/closeout input through [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
Obsidian keeps reusable explanations; SpecMesh project files keep current facts, CapMesh keeps
capability decisions, and History keeps source evidence. This file-based convention does not
change runtime ownership, auto-load a vault into workers, or require a knowledge service.

- Python is authoritative for task lifecycle, recovery, provider processes, transports,
  memory writes, workspace mutation, and persisted runtime behavior.
- JSON Schema under `schemas/controlmesh/v1/` is authoritative for cross-language payload
  shape; generated Python and TypeScript models are not edited directly.
- Public protocol fields use stable snake_case names, allow additive unknown fields where
  forwarding requires it, and never expose absolute artifact paths.
- Persisted fields, task statuses, provider/transport names, and workspace layouts require
  explicit migrations.
- TypeScript runtime ownership stays blocked until canonical Python fixtures demonstrate
  create, tell, ask_parent, resume, cancel, provider, recovery, workspace, and artifact
  parity with rollback gates.
- The Web product remains local-first and binds to `127.0.0.1` by default.
- Secrets, credentials, auth profiles, runtime state, caches, dependency directories, and
  build output must remain untracked.

## Current State

Terminal UX remains a basic line-oriented shell. Runtime and read-only Alpha gates do
not establish terminal product readiness. The user has prioritized an interactive
terminal redesign; its implementation and real-terminal acceptance are still pending.

The Python runtime is mature and remains the production core. It provides the enhanced
terminal, legacy bot runtime, provider adapters, persistent TaskHub, message transports,
memory/workspace behavior, multi-agent supervision, four approved topologies, recovery,
and operational tooling.

The approved TypeScript foundation is complete:

- versioned JSON Schemas and synchronized generated Python/TypeScript models;
- Bearer-protected, read-only Python `/api/v1` facade for tasks, events, providers,
  topologies, artifact metadata, and descriptor-safe artifact downloads;
- runtime-validated TypeScript SDK;
- local read-only Web dashboard;
- protocol, provider and task-lifecycle golden, SDK, facade, artifact-security, and Web build gates.
- GitHub CI runs the frozen protocol/golden/SDK/Web gate as a required product-layer job
  and exposes one aggregate `CI success` check for the complete workflow.

The read-only Alpha introduced in `0.42.0a1` is installable as one Python artifact: the
deterministic dashboard build ships in the wheel, `controlmesh api serve` exposes the
authenticated facade and dashboard only on `127.0.0.1`, and the public Alpha SDK surface
contains only supported read operations. CI includes a required isolated-wheel smoke that
exercises the installed CLI, real HTTP/SDK reads, artifact containment, mutation rejection,
and wheel-bundled dashboard assets.

Mutation-shaped SDK ideas are not supported product behavior. Real task mutation and all
transport/provider execution remain Python-owned.

The canonical Python task-lifecycle parity matrix now executes create, tell, ask_parent,
resume, cancel, recovery, workspace, and artifact ownership paths and records normalized,
JSON-Schema-validated observations. It is a required CI drift gate, not authorization to
add mutation APIs.

The private TypeScript runtime-facade candidate consumes those case inputs and independently
matches all 14 observations. CI dual-runs the live Python oracle and TypeScript candidate,
reports JSON-path drift, and verifies a digest-bound rollback gate that retains Python as
production and rollback owner. OpenAPI, the public SDK, and Web remain read-only.

Provider authentication tests isolate operator XDG paths while retaining explicit XDG
override coverage. The Codex streaming timeout test uses a complete stderr stream double,
so the full Python suite passes with runtime warnings promoted to errors.

Result writeback now fail-closes on cross-identity packets, non-owner reporters, stale
recovery episodes, and conflicting retries. Identical result retries reuse the original
event. Controller promotion requires the current episode's single `completed` result and
rechecks execution, review, and summary freshness immediately before canonical writes. A
production-Python-generated ten-case golden matrix is a required drift gate.

Provider execution now carries a Python-issued source context from ingress to the final
provider boundary. Group messages, bot handoffs, API, cron, webhook, and heartbeat work
fail closed when the confirmed Docker sandbox is unavailable; local foreground and direct
message compatibility remains explicit. Both normal CLI construction and one-shot cron/
webhook/background execution share the same policy evaluator, and task persistence keeps
the context across resume/recovery without storing raw message content or paths.

Feishu groups can opt into multi-bot coordination without changing legacy mention policy:
ordinary messages select one configured coordinator, exact bot mentions select only that
bot, `/all` broadcasts explicitly, silent peers retain bounded passive context, and
bot-authored handoffs require a configured sender, explicit local target, and loop budget.

Feishu domestic long-connection attempts are generation-isolated: startup timeout, stop,
and reconnect cancel exactly the in-flight attempt, superseded connections cannot deliver
to the owner loop, and repeated start/stop cycles leak no threads, ping tasks, or sockets.

## Current Priority

Native OpenCode continuity shipped in v0.42.2: local Viewer discovery, explicit TaskHub
adoption, model preflight and same-session completion passed real terminal acceptance.
See `plans/native-session-adoption/`. This does not close A.1 or terminal product readiness.
History Viewer owns history discovery; CM owns execution; SpecMesh owns reviewed project
intent and status. Native history is contextual evidence, never automatic project truth.

Tool-grant v1 landed at `3417ae0`: provider mapping/rejection, optional task snapshots and
golden drift checks are present. This does not yet establish end-to-end grant enforcement.
The next safety unit is A.1 (`plans/execution-tool-grants-enforcement-closure/`), covering
trusted issuance wiring, network/approval semantics and recovery/delivery identity checks,
before cross-node diagnosis. CI 34041126119 passed for that exact implementation SHA.

The immediate user-facing priority is Terminal Product v1
(`plans/terminal-product-v1/`): deliver a usable terminal workbench with explicit UX
acceptance. The following runtime and operational work remains queued:

1. Collect operational evidence for the hardened writeback/promotion and source-aware
   sandbox gates; keep `test_execution`, `code_review`, and `patch_candidate` task-local/
   controller-promoted.
2. Establish cross-server execution trace/diagnose without recording message bodies or
   credentials, then run process-kill/restart recovery fault injection.
3. Run the documented two-node Feishu multi-bot canary in
   `oc_cdf6d69446db7e9e480067de4f309192` after replacing all open-ID placeholders; do not
   distribute broadly until coordinator, exact-mention, broadcast, loop, and thread checks pass.
4. Review the deferred create/tell/resume/cancel API admission choices—operation scopes,
   idempotency retention, task revisions, audit access, canary policy, and rollback triggers—
   before proposing any public mutation surface.
5. Collect read-only Alpha feedback without expanding the localhost/browser security
   boundary.
6. Decide browser credential storage and operator scope before any non-local Web use.

## Workflow integration (v0.43.0)

Local cron transaction/ownership fixes and an opt-in independent SpecMesh CLI adapter are described in [CODEKIT-INTEGRATION](docs/CODEKIT-INTEGRATION.md). This batch complements the queued terminal/runtime work; it does not complete TypeScript migration, distributed dispatch or operational rollout.

## Approved next direction

The primary coordinating Agent personally owns cross-project delivery. Full TypeScript runtime migration, multi-device coordination and real Agent continuation are explicitly authorized and in progress in the original local workspace, with direct main pushes after verification. Repository-owned details and current status: [runtime-convergence](plans/runtime-convergence/task_plan.md). The private transactional TS kernel is under implementation; current released behavior retains its existing authority until cutover gates pass.
