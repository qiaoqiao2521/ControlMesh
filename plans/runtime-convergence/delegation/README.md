# Delegated execution — 2026-09-13

> Historical worker records, not a current dispatch instruction.
> Superseded as the default direction by [Paperclip-based CM](../../paperclip-based-cm/task_plan.md).
> No old handle, full-TS objective or past push permission is reactivated by this file.

2026-09-14 execution handoff: the parent mixed run is paused. The historical worker
records and native IDs below remain evidence, not dispatch instructions. Current
selection is [bounded-delivery](../../bounded-delivery/task_plan.md); no worker resume,
new Goal, periodic model wake-up or next-card dispatch is authorized by this file alone.

User instruction: conserve primary Codex tokens. Use installed terminal cbc and agy for
verification and simple implementation; primary owns dispatch, integration and acceptance.
Full objective remains TS runtime migration, multi-device coordination and real native
Agent continuation. CM production remains Python 0.43.0. No release/cutover claim.

## Current authoritative handoff (supersedes historical notes below)

| CM job | Native conversation | Execution / acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| cbc-parent-bridge-r2 | CBC 01a09a29-a069-7afe-9ab4-909d055fa089 | completed, result received; rejected and superseded by r3 |
| cbc-parent-bridge-r3 | same CBC conversation | completed exit 0, received; local bridge accepted after primary corrections, 23 tests pass |
| cbc-ci-stability | CBC 01a09a99-315f-74f3-b35d-55e86c299a2e | completed, received; 5cab0c9 pushed, remote CI 34756010064 success |
| agy-cron-batch1 | AGY def64a8d-18c9-49eb-abd4-82488284d15f | worker completed exit 0/SUCCESS; controller 61893 failed final collection; artifacts read; implementation rejected |
| agy-cron-batch1-r2 | same AGY conversation | completed exit 0; received and consumed once (second consume null/3); code rejected with concrete counterexamples |
| agy-cron-batch1-r3 | same AGY conversation | completed/received/consumed; earlier counterexamples fixed, snapshot replacement and deletion lineage rejected |
| agy-cron-batch1-r4 | same AGY conversation | failed wrapper disappeared, exit code unknown; received with review required; native quiescence not proven, no restart yet |
| cbc-cron-recurrence | CBC 01a09aba-fdd5-7569-b07c-a3dc7b707188 | failed wrapper disappeared, exit code unknown; received with review required; cbc ps reports no active sessions; code/tests unfinished |
| cbc-cron-recurrence-recovery | same CBC conversation | process completed exit 0, but stdout is quota 429; application task NOT complete; reset 2026-09-14 17:26:09 UTC+8; do not retry before evidenced reset |
| agy-cron-recovery | AGY def64a8d-18c9-49eb-abd4-82488284d15f | handle 57638 terminal process exit 0; stderr says 20-minute timeout with turn in progress, JSON SUCCESS is partial; no complete report; primary checks show earlier defects fixed, full acceptance pending |

Logical parent: `codex-runtime-convergence`. Isolated CM home and snapshot paths are
documented below. Never restart a terminal worker because its controller failed; never
modify a frozen controller copy while its worker runs. No idle-desktop callback exists.
Next action: inspect native quiescence before any explicit continuation. Old handles
99572/55848 were stopped after their recorded wrapper PIDs were confirmed absent; an
empty exit_code.txt fooled the old controller into waiting forever. The primary fixed
this with 27 passing supervision tests and collected both failed/unknown events. Freeze
the corrected controller before dispatch; do not reuse controller-8f4de54 for recovery.
Preserve unfinished worker code and the raw-field collision review. Historical
bootstrap attempts have older/missing intent fields and must not be silently rebound.

Corrected frozen controller: controller-1c8170b under the same parent-supervision root.
Current next action: finish primary regression acceptance of preserved persistence candidate.
Do not restart 57638 or interpret AGY's partial SUCCESS as application completion.
Do not act on superseded references to the old AGY/CBC handles below.
Fix commit 1c8170b pushed. Recovery handle 42834 is terminal; process exit zero does not
prove a successful native turn. CBC returned only a 429 quota notice. Its raw stdout is
the authoritative failure evidence; a future provider adapter must classify this separately
from generic host-process completion. Do not change the historical process exit code.

## Historical dispatch notes

Read repository AGENTS.md, PROJECT.md and relevant runtime-convergence plan progressively.
No full-document scans. Current base c7058b2. An untracked host-source-ingress.test.ts is
primary work from the interrupted turn: preserve it and complete acceptance, do not erase.

| Worker | Task | File ownership | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| cbc | Validate HostJob source ingress and fix test-only issues | test/host-source-ingress.test.ts; delegation/cbc-result.md | dispatched |
| agy | Prepare concrete cron runtime port specification from actual Python owners | delegation/cron-port-spec.md; delegation/agy-result.md | dispatched |

Each worker must report exact commands, exit codes, logs, changed files, blockers and
native session ID if available. Reports distinguish code, tests and live acceptance.
Primary checks diff and evidence, returns defects to the same CLI session, then commits
and pushes accepted work. No concurrent full-suite runs. No edits outside owned files.
No remote push/release, real account/browser actions, service restart, automation creation,
production state writes or resuming cancelled tasks 77f04609/7738c5eb.

Use current configured CLI model; stop and report auth/quota failure without retry loops.
Keep stdout short; detailed results belong in result files. No further subagents needed.

## Runtime tools

PATH prefix: /home/muqiao/Documents/Codex/2026-09-06/new-chat/outputs/runtime-convergence/ci-bun-bin
UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/cm-runtime-uv-cache
Bun 1.3.11. Workspace pnpm --filter @controlmesh/runtime-core typecheck.
Independent SpecMesh: /home/muqiao/桌面/obsidian/my-programming-world/编程/SpecMesh

## CBC acceptance

Inspect new host-source-ingress.test.ts and relevant host source code. Run this test and
host-job-process.test.ts plus typecheck. Prior new ingress test: 2 pass, 12 assertions;
prior host broad run: 68 pass, 3 skip; standalone SpecMesh configured run 12 pass.
Verify real direct/background source provenance, human approval requirement, rollback of
failed automatic background approval and once-only execution. Fix test defects only;
report production defects with exact lines instead of silently changing source. Do not
rerun all runtime tests. Write cbc-result.md with PASS/FAIL and exact evidence.

## AGY cron plan

Cron is a required owner gap, not DeviceScheduler. Read controlmesh/cron/{manager,observer,
execution,dependency_queue,policy,guarded_store}.py selectively and actual TS scheduling/
ingress/provider integration seams. Produce cron-port-spec.md with existing behavior,
required TS modules and APIs, persistence/migration design, authoritative scheduled origin,
occurrence identity/deduplication, multi-device ownership/fencing, timezone/DST, dependency
ordering, quiet periods, quota/auth circuit breaking, cancellation and output-noise policy.
Name concrete integration points and ordered implementable batches with tests/acceptance.
Preserve existing public schema behavior unless an explicit migration is specified. Explain
which native execution source floors currently reject cron and how to establish actual
sandbox support without weakening host/provider gates. No production implementation yet.
Include code-level proposed interfaces and SQL only where supported by inspected context.
Distinguish observed facts from proposals. Record concise completion in agy-result.md.

## Dispatch handles

- CBC unified exec session: 36570; log /tmp/cm-cbc-delegation.log.
- AGY unified exec session: 35985; log /tmp/cm-agy-delegation.log.
- Both processes returned live handles on dispatch. Poll these handles before restarting;
  absent output is not failure. If plan mode prevents AGY writing, capture its completed
  proposal or continue the same native conversation in accept-edits mode.

AGY first process 35985 ended (exit 0) without work: headless command permission denied.
A replacement was launched with process-local automatic permissions, constrained by task
to read source and write only its two assigned markdown files. Log:
/tmp/cm-agy-delegation-retry.log. No global settings changed; CBC 36570 still running.

Replacement AGY unified exec session: 8244. Poll before any restart.

CBC initial report is INCONCLUSIVE: command permission denied, no tests actually ran.
A scoped retry explicitly allows Bash for the authorized focused tests/typecheck; logs:
/tmp/cm-cbc-acceptance-retry.log, /tmp/cm-cbc-acceptance-tests.log,
/tmp/cm-cbc-acceptance-types.log. No broad static reread or full suite requested.
AGY plan/report are delivered but NOT yet primary-accepted.

Future AGY integration must use a distinct CLI capability profile: current GeminiResumeProcess
pins CLI 0.59.0 and GeminiSessionStore, whereas installed AGY uses --conversation and a
different settings/session system. Do not alias executables or claim native continuity
without AGY session identity, workspace, output protocol, quota and interruption acceptance.

## Google CLI direction correction (verified 2026-09-13)

Official announcement: https://developers.googleblog.com/an-important-update-transitioning-gemini-cli-to-antigravity-cli/
Google's personal/free/AI Pro/Ultra Gemini CLI access stopped on June 18, 2026;
AGY is the replacement direction for this user's workflow. Enterprise/API-key exceptions
exist. Prior personal OAuth UNSUPPORTED_CLIENT must not remain an endlessly retried old-CLI
roadmap blocker. Prioritize native AGY integration and preserve Gemini only as a explicitly
identified legacy/enterprise profile. Do not alias the different native session protocols.
User authorized global no-prompt defaults in AGY and CBC. Do not override CBC's global
bypassPermissions with acceptEdits in routine dispatch. Framework task grants remain an
independent responsibility of CM; global CLI permissions alone do not prove CM enforcement.

## Active primary review, current handles

CBC tests accepted from raw logs and committed/pushed at 93fb734.
CBC parent bridge: unified exec 51930, /tmp/cm-cbc-taskhub-parent.json (JSON output),
/tmp/cm-cbc-taskhub-parent.err. Native session ID must come from actual CLI result.
AGY cron plan REJECTED pending revision: occurrence identity coupled to fencing generation,
unsafe dependency release on TTL alone, and unproven distributed SQLite lease assumptions.
Review instructions: agy-review-1.md. Revision process: unified exec 61557,
/tmp/cm-agy-cron-review-1.json and /tmp/cm-agy-cron-review-1.err.
Both verified live; do not restart on empty output. No model-polling automation created.

## Running through CM after missed handoff

Prior CBC 51930 and AGY 61557 are terminal exit 0; they were NOT being actively
collected after the primary ended its turn. Do not claim an automatic desktop callback.
CBC bridge review 2 is now truly launched using source CM hostjob (single-owner bootstrap):
- job_id: cbc-parent-bridge-r2
- parent: codex-runtime-convergence
- native CBC session: 01a09a29-a069-7afe-9ab4-909d055fa089
- CM home: /home/muqiao/Documents/Codex/2026-09-06/new-chat/outputs/runtime-convergence/parent-supervision/cm-state
- CM wait process unified exec: 45057 (wait-timeout 0)
- launch command detached after 1s (exit 3/no terminal event), status verified running.
Wait process is the active controller's return channel; no periodic model automation.
Do not restart this attempt on timeouts. The old installed 0.43.0 is not changed.
Review flaws: concurrent cold start, parent/definition rebinding, concurrent consume,
PID disappearance uncertainty. Do not publish unaccepted bridge.

## Cron persistence implementation dispatched

- AGY batch 1 assignment: [agy-cron-batch-1.md](agy-cron-batch-1.md).
- CM job `agy-cron-batch1`, parent `codex-runtime-convergence`, same isolated CM home.
- Native AGY conversation `def64a8d-18c9-49eb-abd4-82488284d15f` resumed explicitly.
- Active CM run/wait process: unified exec `61893`, timeout 0; status verified running.
- Launcher: outputs/runtime-convergence/parent-supervision/agy-cron-batch-1.sh in the
  primary workspace. CM owns stdout/stderr/exit_code artifacts. No periodic model job.
- CBC continues its separate Python bridge review; AGY owns TS cron persistence only.
  Both are unaccepted work until primary collects terminal results and reviews evidence.

## Current collection and review

CBC r2 wait `45057` returned a real terminal event: completed, exit 0, 2026-09-13
11:49:50Z. Primary reproduced corrupt DISPATCH.json permitting a new parent/command to
claim the prior completed result; see [review 3](taskhub-parent-review-3.md).
R3 resumed the same native CBC session under CM job `cbc-parent-bridge-r3`, active
run/wait handle `92783`. R2 is terminal and must not be restarted or backfilled with an
invented dispatch binding (it was launched by the pre-review bootstrap version).

Independent CBC CI task: `cbc-ci-stability`, run/wait handle `64503`, native session
`01a09a99-315f-74f3-b35d-55e86c299a2e` observed in CBC's live heartbeat inventory.
It owns only CI workflow/helpers and its report. The first 93fb734 CI attempt failed
Docker info readiness; a single failed-job rerun passed. The TS type failure at d5734e1
  was a genuine earlier defect already fixed at 8651820. Do not weaken required checks.

CI task 64503 completed and was received; accepted CI commit 5cab0c9 is pushed and
remote CI 34756010064 succeeded. Native CI worker is terminal, not to be restarted.

AGY first batch worker completed exit 0/SUCCESS. Supervisor 61893 failed at final
collection with NameError from an intermediate edited module. Original native result
remains in the job stdout; no worker replay is authorized. Primary rejected persistence
correctness and dispatched [revision 2](agy-cron-batch-1-review-2.md): CM job
agy-cron-batch1-r2, active handle 93495, same native AGY conversation.

All new controller commands now run from the frozen controller-r3-snapshot under the
parent-supervision output directory (primary workspace), using the CM checkout's .venv
Python and explicit --repo/--cwd. Its manifest binds 477 copied Python files. The snapshot
passed a completed/exit-0 smoke; never modify or replace it while handle 93495 is active.
CBC bridge revision 3 still runs on handle 92783; its targeted 22 tests passed but the
worker is still producing final evidence. Wait for terminal before touching its files.

Historical note above superseded: CBC 92783 is terminal and local bridge fixes were
accepted/pushed at 8f4de54. AGY 93495 is also terminal and consumed; primary reproduced
null-to-empty conversion, dropped user raw/version/spec_digest and read-created authority.
Current AGY revision 3 is recorded in the authoritative table at the top.

CBC recurrence assignment: [cbc-cron-recurrence.md](cbc-cron-recurrence.md). Native session
was confirmed through CBC heartbeat inventory after CM launch. It does not own database.ts,
cron-store.ts, cron-migration.ts, src/index.ts or AGY's tests. Its optional parser
dependency/package lock changes must be reviewed before integration. No runtime timer or
provider execution is authorized in this batch; Python is a test oracle only.
