# Runtime convergence: full TypeScript migration and multi-device Agent execution

> Historical implementation/evidence only. Superseded as the default direction by
> [Paperclip-based CM](../paperclip-based-cm/task_plan.md); full TS is no longer
> the default investment. All execution authorizations/statuses below are dated snapshots.

## Execution handoff — 2026-09-14

The mixed Goal execution is paused/superseded by [bounded-delivery](../bounded-delivery/task_plan.md).
Retain this plan's CM-R/CM-A IDs, requirements and historical evidence; do not run its old
next-step queue automatically. CM is currently queued after standalone SpecMesh and
History. Migration, device collaboration and native continuation are separate tracks;
Ops is excluded from this batch. The following status is the prior execution snapshot.

## Historical status and ownership

Status: in_progress; full implementation explicitly authorized on 2026-09-11. Owner: CM maintainers/primary coordinating Agent. User authorizes this direction; existing Python ownership remains factual until each migration gate passes. Do not interpret the old read-only-first roadmap as a permanent ban on the approved runtime port.

## Goal

Move runtime authority to TypeScript without losing task correctness, provider enforcement, local/native session context, transport delivery or recoverability. Coordinate concurrent Agents across devices with attributable, bounded message exchange. A green facade prototype is not runtime completion.

## Observed baseline

- `controlmesh/tasks/{hub,registry,models}.py` own existing persisted tasks and transitions.
- `controlmesh/tasks/{native_sessions,native_commands}.py` implement OpenCode identity/revision checks and explicit native adoption; prior native-session-adoption records real terminal completion, not merely mocked tests.
- `controlmesh/cli/`, `controlmesh/runtime/`, `controlmesh/messenger/`, `controlmesh/workspace/` retain process, policy, delivery and filesystem behavior.
- `schemas/controlmesh/` and `packages/controlmesh-{protocol,sdk,runtime-facade,plugin-api}/` contain the protocol/product foundation and private parity candidate; they are not a second authorized task store.
- Cron's new field transactions protect cooperating writers, and observer ownership prevents duplicate runs within one instance. Neither establishes a distributed execution lease.

## Requirements

1. Preserve persisted task IDs/statuses, provenance, model/provider selection, grants and artifact ownership during migration. Add explicit schema/storage version and migration journal; never infer authority from a user-facing prompt.
2. Use one authoritative writer per migrated area. During shadow comparison TS must not issue external tools or duplicate delivery. Route production traffic only after that area passes parity/recovery gates.
3. Admit operations through authenticated principals, scope checks, expected revision and idempotency key; define create/tell/resume/cancel separately. Reject stale ownership with a monotonic fencing token checked at side-effect boundaries.
4. Model device identity, capabilities, trusted workspace mappings and presence separately from task identity. Keep tokens/credential stores device-local; don't copy a provider's private session database as a transport protocol.
5. Durable Agent messages carry message ID, sender, recipient/task, correlation/causation, sequence, origin, scope and expiry. Delivery is at-least-once with idempotent application; acknowledgement means persisted receipt, not successful execution. Bound fan-out, recursion, queues and retries.
6. Quota/auth/model preflight has typed unavailable/degraded/ready outcomes, explicit expiry and bounded probes. Model history is a candidate source, not proof of current quota. Quota failures wait for evidenced reset or operator action rather than creating repeated cron prompts.
7. Preserve native session semantics: explicit session/store/device/directory/revision binding, no silent fallback to fresh conversation, no transcript text promoted to instructions/permissions. Native clients outside CM do not honor CM advisory locks.
8. SpecMesh plugin checks and History retrieval have independent tool APIs; a missing/unknown required gate fails closed. Human UI displays task progress, output, blocking reason, decision and next action first.

## Phases and exit gates

| ID | Deliverable / implementation seam | Exit evidence | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| CM-R0 | Inventory real owners and versioned payloads; extend existing lifecycle/provider/gate goldens | Reproducible baseline plus ledger of every persisted field and side effect | in_progress |
| CM-R1 | TS execution kernel behind existing facade; transitions, events, cancellation, deadlines, process supervision | Python/TS differential traces for success, failure, timeout, cancel, crash/restart; zero duplicate side effects in shadow mode | in_progress: transactional kernel, durable local queue, private stdio and persistent local service/CLI implemented; full process/provider/transport parity and terminal interface pending |
| CM-R2 | Transactional state migration and startup recovery | Dry-run migration counts/digests, interrupted migration replay, rollback compatibility, corrupt-input refusal | in_progress: snapshot migration plus persisted native manifests/reconciliation; other stores/cutover pending |
| CM-R3 | Provider/transport/workspace/grant ports | Actual adapter smoke for each supported provider; grants enforced natively; process tree cleanup and result-delivery reconciliation | in_progress: source/grant/one-shot/container ports; real host/container OpenCode read and local TaskHub and device staged-write/recovery profiles with native auth/state; durable terminal outbox and Feishu text send/readback verified with local HTTP; other provider/write/source profiles, production transport acceptance and remaining transports pending |
| CM-R4 | Device coordinator and worker execution authority | Two-device lease expiry, fencing, clock skew, network partition and worker restart tests; stale worker cannot write or redeliver | in_progress: real ARM64/x64 native writes, retained-proposal recovery and current SpecMesh reads/writes accepted; normal configured startup/control, two task-bound native sessions and linked handoffs accepted; persistent scheduling, real parallel native mailbox exchange and no-replay restart recovery accepted; other profiles and rollout pending |
| CM-R5 | Agent mailbox and task dependency exchange | Duplicate/out-of-order/replayed messages, bounded broadcast, cancellation propagation and backpressure evidence | in_progress: local/device native initial input and actual Agent MCP send/ask/receive/answer accepted with atomic consumption and recovery; real ARM64 coordinator/x64 interrupted completion, reopen and original-session recall passed; local/device topology dispatch and native input integrated; full native topology acceptance pending |
| CM-R6 | History headless candidate + native adoption + SpecMesh lifecycle hooks | Real continuation canary binds provider session, current repo and approved task scope; see HV-H3 / SM-P2 | in_progress: real same-session recall/current-file and post-SIGKILL continuation passed; normal device-local adoption of an unmanaged native session and model-free recovery accepted; independent SpecMesh start/handoff gate and five-file real native consumption and post-publication continuity recheck accepted locally and on an actual device worker; reviewed closeout and full matrix remain |
| CM-R7 | Staged default switch and Python retirement | Canary -> selected device -> default rollout; telemetry and rollback thresholds met; old writer disabled before new writer activation | planned |

## Acceptance matrix

- CM-A01: repeated submit with same identity and body returns one task; conflicting body rejects.
- CM-A02: lose coordinator/worker after external side effect but before acknowledgement; recovery reconciles outcome before retry.
- CM-A03: expired lease and delayed old worker output cannot overwrite new owner or complete canceled task.
- CM-A04: quota/auth failure does not advance completed state, trigger unbounded probes or create duplicate user messages.
- CM-A05: trace provenance distinguishes human request, schedule, agent message and recovery replay. Scheduler content never appears as a newly authorized human instruction.
- CM-A06: resumes preserve original provider session and current authorization; missing source or changed revision blocks and explains reinspection.
- CM-A07: native writes or uncommitted repository changes invalidate stale acceptance. Unknown external outcomes stay unknown.
- CM-A08: upgrade/restart retains task/artifact lineage and does not revive explicitly canceled tasks.
- CM-A09: device disconnect/backlog limits and loop budget tested without real browser accounts.
- CM-A10: clean install, upgrade, packaged assets, protocol schema, TS typecheck and CI all bind the released SHA.

## Rollback and failure policy

Before migrating live data, snapshot format/version/digests and rehearse rollback on synthetic copies. Stop admission, fence old workers and reconcile in-flight side effects before switching writer. Never dual-write production tasks to Python JSON and a TS prototype. Retain a compatibility reader until migrated artifacts and events can be read after rollback. Freeze rollout on duplicate external actions, missing events, grant expansion, unresolved completion or repeated quota probes; do not automatically roll back by rerunning tasks.

## Dependencies and plan authority

- History discovery/context contract: https://github.com/muqiao215/Codex-Claude-History-Viewer/blob/main/plans/agent-handoff-service/task_plan.md
- Independent workflow gate: https://github.com/muqiao215/specmesh/blob/main/plans/independent-plugin-port/task_plan.md
- Ops operational canary is private and remains in Ops-Vault's fleet-workflow-rollout plan; do not publish inventory or credentials here.

## Non-goals for the current release

No claim that full TS migration or distributed coordination has completed. A scoped real TS OpenCode continuation canary has passed; it does not close all provider/device/SpecMesh gates. No production browser-account execution from writing this plan. Prior verified Python native OpenCode adoption remains completed historical evidence, with its documented cross-client locking limit.

## Next Step

1. Use the verified local CM parent bridge with an active non-model run/wait channel and
   a frozen controller version. CBC r3 returned a real completion; 23 targeted tests
   pass after primary status/orphan-artifact corrections. Local bridge publication is
   separate from its future TS owner port and from an idle desktop callback. The updated
   Python ownership inventory includes this new owner. See delegation/README.md for
   native identities and current handles; do not restart terminal attempts.
   Continue cron owner parity: recurrence and offline persistence are committed; primary
   has integrated transactional TaskIngress admission plus persisted cursors, due/quiet
   checks and FIFO dependency waits. Candidate service startup, atomic queue registration,
   kernel result projection, cancellation and same-device generation recovery are wired
   with scoped tests. Quota circuits, real worker execution/delivery and cross-device
   acceptance remain pending. CBC is quota-blocked and
   AGY returned partial timeout output; current attempt facts belong in delegation/README.md.
   The actual Python owners and adversarial evidence remain authoritative over the proposal.
2. Complete the remaining ownership/acceptance matrix below. Prioritize normal execution,
   transport delivery and recovery across supported providers/devices over disconnected
   helper additions. Do not waive an original requirement to obtain a release.
3. Prioritize native AGY integration for the user's Google CLI workflow. Official personal
   Gemini CLI service retired on June 18, 2026; stop treating its account rejection as a
   temporary blocker for a forward legacy port. Preserve explicit enterprise/API legacy
   compatibility without renaming persisted session references. CBC/AGY process completion
   and their native conversation continuity require separate acceptance.
4. Rehearse data migration/rollback and clean installation before CM-R7. Production remains
   Python until its writer is fenced and the TS cutover gates actually pass.

## Current implementation and evidence

Use [progress.md](progress.md) for the current implementation map, exact latest validation,
known blockers and remaining deliverables. Use [findings.md](findings.md) only for deeper
native behavior and historical experiments; later corrections supersede older assumptions.
Historical checkpoint text removed from this plan remains in Git at `3a56eed`.

- Host execution: configured workunit routing, bounded lease renewal, durable streamed
  output, independent execution owner and same-approved-plan offline advancement exist.
  See [host-parity.md](host-parity.md) for remaining source/environment/deployment limits.
- Gemini: configured local text continuation, durable recovery and model preflight exist.
  Actual public CLI rejects `--ignore-env`; effective merged
  `advanced.ignoreLocalEnv=true` is required instead. The current real OAuth account path
  was rejected by the server with `UNSUPPORTED_CLIENT`. Text fixtures do not establish
  tool-bearing execution, Viewer adoption or real-account continuation.
- Native OpenCode/Claude/Codex and device/topology implementations have scoped evidence,
  detailed in progress/findings. It does not close all native models, physical devices,
  transports, terminal UX or migration/cutover gates.

## Completion rule

CM-R0–R7 and CM-A01–A10 retain their original scope. A green helper test, facade, synthetic
model fixture, policy file, historical device canary or local commit is not full runtime
completion. Each remaining owner needs its relevant code, native/operational evidence,
recovery and rollout gate. No current release or default-TS claim is authorized by this
plan's in-progress checkpoints alone.
