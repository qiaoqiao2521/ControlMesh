# ControlMesh Plans

Repository-level memory is indexed by `AGENTS.md` and `PROJECT.md`. Architecture and
durable rationale live in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

This directory contains historical plans and active task memory. For substantial new work,
create only:

```text
plans/<task>/
  task_plan.md
  findings.md
  progress.md
```

Simple tasks do not need a plan directory.

This directory is the working control plane for ControlMesh.

ControlMesh does not treat chat history as project truth.
It treats files as project truth.

The operating rule is:

- read canonical files first
- dispatch bounded work second
- review evidence before promotion
- update canonical state only after adjudication

## Current work (2026-09-11)

Current work is selected here; older task files are dated evidence, not competing priorities.

- Release alignment: [plan](release-alignment/task_plan.md), [status](release-alignment/progress.md).
- Active product work: [Terminal Product v1](terminal-product-v1/task_plan.md) — implementation pending.
- Queued safety closure: [A.1](execution-tool-grants-enforcement-closure/task_plan.md) — not established by native adoption.
- Completed delivery: [Native session adoption](native-session-adoption/task_plan.md) — v0.42.2.

```

## Ground Rules

- `PROJECT.md` is canonical for project intent and current priority.
- An active `plans/<task>/` directory is canonical only for that task's execution state.
- Product lines get their own sibling directories copied from `_line_template/`.
- `tasks/<task-id>/` is task-local evidence space, not canonical truth.
- Background workers may write only task-local outputs and proposed updates.
- Canonical files are promoted only by the controller after adjudication.

## Standard Progression

Every meaningful cut should move through:

`design -> red -> green -> live -> checkpoint`

If the problem changes:

- `split_into_new_scope`

If the line must end:

- `stopline`

If the line is valid but should not continue now:

- `deferred_with_reason`

## Frontstage vs Runtime

- Frontstage history: visible user interaction only
- Runtime/event surface: task lifecycle, retries, heartbeats, worker activity, recovery, diagnostics

Do not mix them.

## Current work (2026-09-29)

- Current direction/status: [Orca bridge candidate](../docs/orca-bridge-status.md). The owner-local candidate is partially implemented; full acceptance and production cutover remain open. This documentation update does not publish its implementation or private server evidence.
- [Runtime convergence](runtime-convergence/task_plan.md) is retained as historical implementation/evidence, not the current execution queue. Do not automatically resume old next-step lists.
